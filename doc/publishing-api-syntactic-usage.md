# Publishing API syntactic usage

This is the primary interface from publishing apps to the publishing pipeline. Applications PUT items as JSON conforming to a schema specified in govuk-content-schemas.
Content paths are arbitrated internally by the Publishing API, the content is then forwarded to the live and draft content stores, and placed on the message queue for other apps (eg email-alert-service) to consume.

PUT and POST endpoints take an optional integer field `previous_version` in the request, the purpose of this field is to validate that the publishing app sending the request intends to update the latest lock version of the model in question. Further details of this optimistic locking scenario can be found here.

## `PUT /v2/content/:content_id`

[Request/Response detail](https://pact-broker.dev.publishing.service.gov.uk/pacts/provider/Publishing%20API/consumer/GDS%20API%20Adapters/latest#a_request_from_the_Whitehall_application_to_create_a_content_item_at_/test-item_given_/test-item_has_been_reserved_by_the_Publisher_application)

 - Creates or updates a draft content item with the following steps:
 - Validates that the incoming request is attempting to update the correct internal lock version of the content item. Responds with 409 when lock version validation fails.
 - Instantiates a new content item or retrieves an existing item matching the content_id and locale passed in the request.
 - Validates the content item prior to saving. There are multiple validations for draft content items, the main concerns are path integrity, identity uniqueness and lock version consistency. Validation failures in these cases respond with 422.
 - Increments the lock version number of the content item.
 - Prepares and sends the draft content item payload downstream to the content store. The payload is modified to include a payload_version to validate message ordering.
 - Sends the draft content item payload to the message queue.

### Required request params:
 - `content_id` the primary identifier for the content being created or updated.
Requests to create a new draft content item:
 - `base_path` must be a valid path
format

 - `public_updated_at` required unless format is redirect or gone
 - `phase` must be one of alpha, beta, live

### Optional request params:
 - `locale` (optional, defaults to en) must be one of I18n.available_locales
Requests to update an existing draft content item:
 - `previous_version` (optional but advised) is used to ensure the request is updating the latest lock version of this draft. ie. optimistic locking.
