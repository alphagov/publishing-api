# Publishing API's API

This is the primary interface from publishing apps to the publishing pipeline.
Applications PUT items as JSON conforming to a schema specified in
[govuk-content-schemas][govuk-content-schemas-repo].

Content locations are arbitrated internally by the Publishing API, the content
is then forwarded to the live and draft content stores, and placed on the
message queue for other apps (e.g. `email-alert-service`) to consume.

## Endpoints

### Optimistic locking (`previous_version`)

All PUT and POST endpoints take an optional JSON attribute `previous_version`
in the request. If given, the corresponding value should be a integer. This
allows the Publishing API to check that the publishing app sending the request
intends to update the latest lock version of the model in question.

If `previous_version` is provided, the Publishing API will confirm that the
provided value matches that of the edition in the Publishing API. If it
does not, a 409 Conflict response will be provided.

### Warnings

Some endpoints may return warnings along with the content. For
those that do, in the top level object for the content, there
will be a value named "warnings". This will be an object, where the
names are the warnings that are applicable, and the corresponding
values are a human readable description of the warning.

#### Content Item Blocking Publish

This warning is only applicable for documents with an edition in a draft state,
and indicates that the draft cannot be published due to the presence of an
edition of a different at the base_path this edition is using.

Some document types are exempt from this restriction, and if either the draft,
or the blocking edition are of a "substitutable" document type, upon the
publish of the draft, the blocking item will be unpublished.

## `PUT /v2/content/:content_id`

[Request/Response detail][put-content-pact]

Used to create or update a draft edition of a document. It will restrict
creation if there is different document with a draft edition using the same
`base_path`. Uses [optimistic-locking][optimistic-locking].

The request must conform to the schema defined in govuk-content-schemas if it
does not a 422 response will be returned.

If the request is successful, this endpoint will respond with the
presented edition and [warnings](#warnings).

    for backwards compatibility, the top-level `change_note` attribute
    should be used instead.
	- If `details` has a member named `change_note`, that is used.

      `change_history`, then the `note` with the latest corresponding
      `public_timestamp` is used.
