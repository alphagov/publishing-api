# Publishing API

This is a Rails application that proxies requests to multiple content-stores. Our
use case for this is to keep two copies of the frontend of GOV.UK running: one
which the public sees and another which is only used by people working on
content to review work in progress.

Publishing apps will talk to the publishing-api rather than the content-store.
Normal publishing requests are forwarded to both the live and draft
content-stores, whereas draft documents would only be forwarded to the draft
content-store.

Decisions about the design of the publishing api are recorded as [architecture
decision records](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-
architecture-decisions) in the [`doc/arch`](doc/arch) folder.

### Dependencies

- [alphagov/url-arbiter](https://github.com/alphagov/url-arbiter) - publishing-api will take over content-store's job of updating url-arbiter. This is to prevent race conditions as two content-stores try to register with the same url-arbiter.
- [alphagov/content-store](https://github.com/alphagov/content-store) - publishing-api's function is to proxy requests to multiple content-stores (eg a draft and a live content-store)

Publishing API relies on RabbitMQ as its messaging bus. If you are using the
development VM, it will be installed for you and the required users and topic
exchanges will be set up. If not, you need to install RabbitMQ and add them
yourself. Once RabbitMQ is installed, visit http://localhost:15672 and:

1. add a `publishing_api` user (under "Admin") with the password `publishing_api`
2. add a `published_documents` and a `published_documents_test` topic exchange
   (under "Exchanges")
3. give the `publishing_api` user permissions for the new exchanges.

A more detailed specification of how to configure RabbitMQ can be found in the
[puppet manifest](https://github.gds/gds/puppet/blob/master/modules/govuk/manifests/apps/publishing_api/rabbitmq.pp)
for the publishing API.

Publishing API also requires a Redis instance to be installed.

For Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

For OSX:

```
brew install redis-server
```

Publishing to the message queue can be disabled by setting the
`DISABLE_QUEUE_PUBLISHER` environment variable.

## Post-publishing notifications

After a content item is added or updated, a message is published to RabbitMQ.
It will be published to the `published_documents` topic exchange with the
routing_key `"#{content_item.format}.#{content_item.update_type}"`. Interested parties can
subscribe to this exchange to perform post-publishing actions. For example, a
search indexing service would be able to add/update the search index based on
these messages. Or an email notification service would be able to send email
updates (see https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-service).

### Running the application

`./startup.sh`

Dependencies will be dowloaded and installed and the app should start up on
port 3093. Currently on GOV.UK machines it also be available at
`publishing-api-temp.dev.gov.uk`, but this will change to
`publishing-api.dev.gov.uk` in the near future.

## Running the test suite

You can run the tests locally with: `bundle exec rake`.

## Running the contract tests

The publishing API includes contract tests which verify that the service
behaves in the way expected by its clients. We use a library called
[`pact`](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) which follows the *consumer driven contract testing* pattern. What this means is:

* the expected interactions are defined in the [publishing_api_test.rb in gds-api-adapters](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-api-adapters/blob/master/test/publishing_api_test.rb#L19)
* when these tests are run they output a pactfile which is published to [the pact broker](https://pact-broker.dev.publishing.service.gov.uk/)
* the build of publishing api will use this pactfile to test the publishing-api service

The pacts are verified as part of the main test suite run. This verifies
against the pactfiles from both the latest release version, and the master
branch.

You can run the pact verification tests on their own using:

```
$ bundle exec rake pact:verify
```

### Running the contract tests when offline

If you need to run the contract tests when you don't have access to [the
pact-broker](https://pact-broker.dev.publishing.service.gov.uk/), you can run
them against a local file by setting the `USE_LOCAL_PACT` env variable. This
will cause pact to look for the pactfile in
`../gds-api-adapters/spec/pacts/gds_api_adapters-publishing_api.json`. You can
additionally override this location by setting the `GDS_API_PACT_PATH`
variable.

## Example API requests

``` sh
curl https://publishing-api-temp.production.alphagov.co.uk/content<base_path> -X PUT \
    -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
    -d '<content_item_json>'
```

See the documentation for [content-store](https://github.com/alphagov/content-store) for full details.
