    "body": "<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>English language consultancy <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bestbusinessenglish.com\">Best Business English</a> has successfully entered the Turkish market after receiving help from UK Trade and Investment (<abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr>). Best Business English took part in 2 <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> market visits and used <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr>’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/export-communications-review\">Export Communication Review</a> (<abbr title=\"Export Communications Review\">ECR</abbr>) to prepare for market entry.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Keith, Director, Best Business English found the support of <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> invaluable,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I never dreamed I would be an exporter before I began working with <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr>. The network, services and products have made exporting possible for Best Business English.</p>\n\n  <p>They are a vital support service and held in high esteem in other markets, giving my business further accreditation to prospective clients.</p>\n\n  <p>The <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> market visits offer a valuable experience. The events you attend and people you meet, as well as the wider <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> network available, are inspirational for businesses looking to export.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">It has given me the confidence to get out there and export. <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> is the first stop for any business looking to export.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-business-in-turkey\">New business in Turkey</h2>\n\n<p>The English language consultancy has won deals with several businesses based in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>Success includes working with the Turkish branch of Danish maritime safety company, Viking Life-Saving Equipment at its office near Istanbul. Best Business English is working to improve the business English language skills of staff for communications with their parent company and non-Turkish customers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"preparing-to-go-global\">Preparing to go global</h2>\n\n<p>Nick Keith worked with a <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr>  International Trade Adviser (<abbr title=\"International Trade Adviser\">ITA</abbr>) to assess his export strategy and options after he first approached <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> for help.</p>\n\n<p>He was advised to concentrate on entering one market at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Nick chose to enter the Turkish market due to his fondness of the country and culture, but also because of the potential opportunities in his sector:</p>\n\n<p>Nick Keith said,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I found that many European markets were already saturated with ‘English for business’ consultancies. This competition would make it more challenging for Best Business English to succeed in these markets.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">After some initial research, I discovered that I offered a much more niche service in Turkey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"market-visit-to-research-the-turkish-market\">Market visit to research the Turkish market</h2>\n\n<p>Nick Keith joined another <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> market visit to Istanbul in 2014. During this visit he was able to experience the business culture and etiquette first-hand. He was also able to meet with prospective partners and clients.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Keith said,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You learn more about a market the more often you visit it.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">During my market visit in 2014, I established important differences between how we do business in Britain, and how business is done in Turkey. For example, telephone communication is often preferred to emails, and building a friendly and trusting relationship is a crucial factor for Turkish businesses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"developing-a-communications-strategy\">Developing a communications strategy</h2>\n\n<p>After visiting the market he realised the need to develop an international communications strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Keith made use of <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr>’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/export-communications-review\"><abbr title=\"Export Communications Review\">ECR</abbr></a> service to further help prepare for doing business in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>This recommended refining website Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and content, with advice to translate some webpages into Turkish.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Keith said,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <abbr title=\"Export Communications Review\">ECR</abbr> has helped me optimise my website for Turkish consumption.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Having part of the website in Turkish is very important, especially as many of my potential clients do not yet speak English with confidence. As a result, Turkish businesses visiting my website will be more engaged and eager to do business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"developing-contacts\">Developing contacts</h2>\n\n<p>Nick Keith joined a <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> market visit to Istanbul in February 2015. This time, Nick was able to continue talks with prospects and clients and gain new business in the market.</p>\n\n<p>He was also able to take advantage of a business-to-business (B2B) event organised by the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bcct.org.tr/\">British Chamber of Commerce in Turkey</a> (<abbr title=\"British Chamber of Commerce in Turkey\">BCCT</abbr>). This enabled the market visit delegates to meet with prospective clients.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Keith said,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Overall this year’s market visit has been fantastic. There have been some really interesting networking opportunities and I have managed to create some great contacts.</p>\n\n  <p>In particular, I have a further 2 meetings lined up over the next couple weeks with companies I met at the <abbr title=\"British Chamber of Commerce in Turkey\">BCCT</abbr> B2B event.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">This has granted me a great entry point with businesses who I am now able to build a relationship with and further assess their requirements for my service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"future-business-prospects\">Future business prospects</h2>\n\n<p>Nick is planning stage a seminar at the British Consulate for Turkish companies in October 2015 in conjunction with <abbr title=\"British Chamber of Commerce in Turkey\">BCCT</abbr>. This will be hosted by a panel of English-speaking business experts from different Western countries.</p>\n\n<p>Best Business English are looking forward to another successful year of exporting to Turkey, with plans to expand into other surrounding markets in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Nick Keith said,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Turkey is the perfect springboard into surrounding markets such as south Caucasus, central Asia and the Middle East.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">There is potential for business opportunities outside of Turkey’s borders which I am looking to expand into in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lev Denker, <abbr title=\"International Trade Adviser\">ITA</abbr> and Turkey market visit leader, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is great to see Best Business English making inroads into the Turkish market.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Nick researched and understood the market well during his first mission to Turkey and went back with a product that fulfils the requirements of corporate clients in Turkey - a recipe for success.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"about-best-business-english\">About Best Business English</h2>\n\n<p>Nick Keith established Best Business English as a consultancy to train non-English speaking businesses in English language and Western culture.</p>\n\n<p>It offers specialised and tailored consultancy based on the objectives and industry sector of its clients.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fast-facts\">Fast facts</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Case study</td>\n      <td>Trade</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Company</td>\n      <td>Best Business English</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Industry</td>\n      <td>Education and training</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Target market</td>\n      <td>Turkey</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n<abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> services</td>\n      <td>\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/market-visit-support\">Market Visit</a>; <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/passport-to-export-service\">Passport to Export</a>; <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/export-communications-review\">Export Communication Review</a>\n</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Website</td>\n      <td><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bestbusinessenglish.com\">www.bestbusinessenglish.com</a></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n</div>",
