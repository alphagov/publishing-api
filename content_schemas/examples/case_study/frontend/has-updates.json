The Vaccine Assay and Immune Response team within <abbr title=\"Vaccine Development and Evaluation Centre\">VDEC</abbr> provides world class scientific expertise and regulated facilities to enable the classification of diseases, pathogens and their mechanisms of action. They also provide continued national surveillance after the release of vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>They have recently been supporting the creation of a maternal vaccine for Group B Streptococcus (<abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr>).</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n  <h2 id=\"work-with-vdec\">Work with <abbr title=\"Vaccine Development and Evaluation Centre\">VDEC</abbr>\n</h2>\n  <p>We work with industry, academia and government.

As such, <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> is a leading driver of antibiotic use in neonatal settings, and antimicrobial resistance is increasing.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce early-onset disease (usually within the first 48 hours of life) many countries have introduced screening for <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> in pregnancy. Culture positive mothers are then given intravenous antibiotics in childbirth to protect both the mother and the infant. This has dramatically increased the use of antibiotics in childbirth. In some countries over 50% of childbirths now involve intravenous antibiotic use.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"aims\">Aims</h2>\n\n<p>A maternal vaccine for <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> which protects infants from both early and late onset disease (for which intrapartum antibiotics have no effect) will have a positive impact on infant mortality and morbidity. It will also lead to a sharp reduction in the use of antibiotics in neonatal units worldwide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"issues\">Issues</h2>\n\n<p>Reducing antibiotic use in newborns will allow the development of appropriate commensal gut bacteria. This enables them to digest milk and reduces the risk of antimicrobial resistance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"options\">Options</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\">UKHSA</abbr> Pathogen Immunology Group at Porton Down had previously been part of the GASTON consortium. This is an international consortium to develop standardised correlates of protection to allow the evaluation of new <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> vaccines and enable licensure of the leading candidates.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\">UKHSA</abbr> Porton successfully developed a ‘Gold Standard’ opsonophagocytic killing assay (<abbr title=\"opsonophagocytosis killing assay\">OPKA</abbr>) and led a global interlaboratory study of the <abbr title=\"opsonophagocytosis killing assay\">OPKA</abbr> in public health, academic and industry labs. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive and reproducible in different laboratories, and standard <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> test strains have been selected by <abbr title=\"UK Health Security Agency\">UKHSA</abbr> and made available worldwide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-vdec-offers\">What <abbr title=\"Vaccine Development and Evaluation Centre\">VDEC</abbr> offers</h2>\n\n<p>In 2022 to 2023, follow-on funding was awarded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (<abbr title=\"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\">BMGF</abbr>) to develop a higher-throughput version of the <abbr title=\"opsonophagocytosis killing assay\">OPKA</abbr> suitable for Phase II/III clinical trials and to provide international reference serum samples with defined units of opsonophagocytic activity. The high throughput <abbr title=\"opsonophagocytosis killing assay\">OPKA</abbr> is required as the current assay method is very labour-intensive which limits the number of sera that can be analysed in large vaccine studies.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"expected-outcome\">Expected outcome</h2>\n\n<p>Licensure of a <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> vaccine will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>prevent the deaths of tens of thousands of newborns worldwide</li>\n  <li>reduce the need for antibiotic treatment in disease cases</li>\n  <li>reduce the need for intrapartum antibiotics during childbirth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"future-work\">Future work</h2>\n\n<p>As part of this project, the team has also developed an <abbr title=\"opsonophagocytosis killing assay\">OPKA</abbr> for <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> serotype VII, which will be used in a follow-up <abbr title=\"Program for Appropriate Technology in Health\">PATH</abbr>-funded Phase I/II clinical study of a novel 6-valent <abbr title=\"Group B Streptococcus\">GBS</abbr> vaccine currently being developed.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<h4 id=\"download-this-case-study-as-a-pdfhttpskhubnetdocuments1359395611035034427vdec-gp-strep-case-studypdfaea57e70-60cf-2090-12a0-96d50316cc59\"><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://khub.net/documents/135939561/1035034427/VDEC-Gp+-Strep-case-study.pdf/aea57e70-60cf-2090-12a0-96d50316cc59\" class=\"govuk-link\">Download this case study as a PDF</a></h4>\n</div>\n\n</div>",
