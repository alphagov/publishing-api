This means it’s not subject to scrutiny and assessment by the UK Statistics Authority.</p><h2 id=\"mot-test-results-by-class\">MOT test results by class</h2><p>The MOT test checks that your vehicle meets road safety and environmental standards. Different types of vehicles (eg cars and motorcycles) fall into different ‘classes’.</p><p>This data table shows the number of initial tests. It doesn’t include abandoned tests, aborted tests, or retests.</p><p>The initial fail rate is the rate for vehicles as they were brought for the MOT. The final fail rate excludes vehicles that pass the test after rectification of minor defects at the time of the test.</p><section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1286048\"><div
