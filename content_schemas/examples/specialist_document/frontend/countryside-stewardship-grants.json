This lets insects move to safety when fields are being sprayed. </p>\n\n<p>Spacing five 0.5ha patches evenly within 100ha meets the food needs of many pollinators. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-to-sow\">What to sow</h3>\n\n<p>The seed mix used should contain both short-term nectar rich and perennial wildflower plants, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>early and late flowering red clovers</li>\n  <li>alsike clover </li>\n  <li>sainfoin</li>\n  <li>birdsfoot trefoil </li>\n  <li>black knapweed </li>\n  <li>musk mallow</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sow at 12kg per ha to provide enough plants. </p>\n\n<p>Avoid short-term mixes that do not include knapweed or mallow as they will not supply pollinators with long-term food sources for years 4 and 5 of the agreement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-sow\">How to sow</h3>\n\n<p>Sow by broadcasting seeds rather than drilling, when the soil is warm and moist. Use a ring roll before and after sowing. Check regularly for slug damage. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"management\">Management</h3>\n\n<p>Cut emerging flowers and weeds at least twice in year 1, and up to 4 times if necessary where the soil is particularly fertile. Regular cutting prevents weeds smothering the slow-growing flowers so all sown species are established successfully. </p>\n\n<p>Plots may be grazed between 1 September and 14 March, but (as set out in the Mid Tier Manual section 6.2.1 General management requirements) make sure that no poaching or soil compaction by livestock takes place. Supplementary feeding could result in poaching and soil compaction, so should be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that nectar plots should be kept until at least 31 December in year 5 of the agreement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"further-information\">Further information</h3>\n\n<p>Order the ‘Growing farm wildlife’ DVD from Natural England which gives a step-by-step approach to sowing nectar flower mixtures. </p>\n\n",
