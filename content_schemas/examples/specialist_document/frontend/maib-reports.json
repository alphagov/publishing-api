Margriet was seriously damaged both above and below the waterline. Approximately 8 tons of diesel oil escaped from a damaged fuel tank. Orakai sustained minor damage. There were no injuries.</p>\n\n<p>The investigation identified that Margriet’s wheelhouse watchkeeper was not keeping an effective lookout. He had not seen the tanker, which was only 1 nautical mile away when he altered course towards it. The investigation also identified that Orakai’s officer of the watch had left an inexperienced ordinary seaman alone on the bridge. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"recommendations\">Recommendations</h3>\n\n<p>MAIB has made recommendation 2015/140\tto Margriet’s owner, Kafish B.V. aimed at improving the standards of watchkeeping on its vessels, with particular regard to the additional risks associated with fishing in or near traffic separation schemes and other areas of potential high traffic density.</p>\n\n<p>Recommendation 2015/141 has been made to Orakai’s manager, South End Tanker Management B.V., to reiterate to its fleet that an officer of the watch should not leave the bridge unless relieved by another qualified officer.</p>\n",
