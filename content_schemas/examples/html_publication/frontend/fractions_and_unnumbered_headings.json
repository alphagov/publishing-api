    "body": "<div class=\"govspeak\"><h3 id=\"purpose-of-study\">Purpose of study</h3>\n\n<p>Mathematics is a creative and highly interconnected discipline that has been developed over centuries, providing the solution to some of history’s most intriguing problems. It is essential to everyday life, critical to science, technology and engineering, and necessary for financial literacy and most forms of employment. A high-quality mathematics education therefore provides a foundation for understanding the world, the ability to reason mathematically, an appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematics, and a sense of enjoyment and curiosity about the subject.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"aims\">Aims</h3>\n\n<p>The national curriculum for mathematics aims to ensure that all pupils:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics, including through varied and frequent practice with increasingly complex problems over time, so that pupils develop conceptual understanding and the ability to recall and apply knowledge rapidly and accurately</li>\n  <li>reason mathematically by following a line of enquiry, conjecturing relationships and generalisations, and developing an argument, justification or proof using mathematical language</li>\n  <li>can solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions</li>\n</ul><p>Mathematics is an interconnected subject in which pupils need to be able to move fluently between representations of mathematical ideas. The programmes of study are, by necessity, organised into apparently distinct domains, but pupils should make rich connections across mathematical ideas to develop fluency, mathematical reasoning and competence in solving increasingly sophisticated problems. They should also apply their mathematical knowledge to science and other subjects.</p>\n\n<p>The expectation is that the majority of pupils will move through the programmes of study at broadly the same pace. However, decisions about when to progress should always be based on the security of pupils’ understanding and their readiness to progress to the next stage. Pupils who grasp concepts rapidly should be challenged through being offered rich and sophisticated problems before any acceleration through new content. Those who are not sufficiently fluent with earlier material should consolidate their understanding, including through additional practice, before moving on.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"information-and-communication-technology-ict\">Information and communication technology (ICT)</h3>\n\n<p>Calculators should not be used as a substitute for good written and mental arithmetic. They should therefore only be introduced near the end of key stage 2 to support pupils’ conceptual understanding and exploration of more complex number problems, if written and mental arithmetic are secure. In both primary and secondary schools, teachers should use their judgement about when ICT tools should be used.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"spoken-language\">Spoken language</h3>\n\n<p>The national curriculum for mathematics reflects the importance of spoken language in pupils’ development across the whole curriculum – cognitively, socially and linguistically. The quality and variety of language that pupils hear and speak are key factors in developing their mathematical vocabulary and presenting a mathematical justification, argument or proof. They must be assisted in making their thinking clear to themselves as well as others, and teachers should ensure that pupils build secure foundations by using discussion to probe and remedy their misconceptions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"school-curriculum\">School curriculum</h3>\n\n<p>The programmes of study for mathematics are set out year-by-year for key stages 1 and 2. Schools are, however, only required to teach the relevant programme of study by the end of the key stage. Within each key stage, schools therefore have the flexibility to introduce content earlier or later than set out in the programme of study. In addition, schools can introduce key stage content during an earlier key stage, if appropriate. All schools are also required to set out their school curriculum for mathematics on a year-by-year basis and make this information available online.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attainment-targets\">Attainment targets</h3>\n\n<p>By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Schools are not required by law to teach the example content in [square brackets] or the content indicated as being ‘non-statutory’.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"key-stage-1---years-1-and-2\">Key stage 1 - years 1 and 2</h2>\n\n<p>The principal focus of mathematics teaching in key stage 1 is to ensure that pupils develop confidence and mental fluency with whole numbers, counting and place value. This should involve working with numerals, words and the 4 operations, including with practical resources [for example, concrete objects and measuring tools].</p>\n\n<p>At this stage, pupils should develop their ability to recognise, describe, draw, compare and sort different shapes and use the related vocabulary. Teaching should also involve using a range of measures to describe and compare different quantities such as length, mass, capacity/volume, time and money.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of year 2, pupils should know the number bonds to 20 and be precise in using and understanding place value. An emphasis on practice at this early stage will aid fluency.</p>\n\n<p>Pupils should read and spell mathematical vocabulary, at a level consistent with their increasing word reading and spelling knowledge at key stage 1.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"year-1-programme-of-study\">Year 1 programme of study</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---number-and-place-value\">Number - number and place value</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>count to and across 100, forwards and backwards, beginning with 0 or 1, or from any given number</li>\n  <li>count, read and write numbers to 100 in numerals; count in multiples of 2s, 5s and 10s</li>\n  <li>given a number, identify 1 more and 1 less</li>\n  <li>identify and represent numbers using objects and pictorial representations including the number line, and use the language of: equal to, more than, less than (fewer), most, least</li>\n  <li>read and write numbers from 1 to 20 in numerals and words</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils practise counting (1, 2, 3…), ordering (for example, first, second, third…), and to indicate a quantity (for example, 3 apples, 2 centimetres), including solving simple concrete problems, until they are fluent.<br><br>\nPupils begin to recognise place value in numbers beyond 20 by reading, writing, counting and comparing numbers up to 100, supported by objects and pictorial representations.<br><br>\nThey practise counting as reciting numbers and counting as enumerating objects, and counting in 2s, 5s and 10s from different multiples to develop their recognition of patterns in the number system (for example, odd and even numbers), including varied and frequent practice through increasingly complex questions.<br><br>\nThey recognise and create repeating patterns with objects and with shapes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---addition-and-subtraction\">Number - addition and subtraction</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>read, write and interpret mathematical statements involving addition (+), subtraction (−) and equals (=) signs</li>\n  <li>represent and use number bonds and related subtraction facts within 20</li>\n  <li>add and subtract one-digit and two-digit numbers to 20, including 0</li>\n  <li>solve one-step problems that involve addition and subtraction, using concrete objects and pictorial representations, and missing number problems such as 7 = ? − 9</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils memorise and reason with number bonds to 10 and 20 in several forms (for example, 9 + 7 = 16; 16 − 7 = 9; 7 = 16 − 9). They should realise the effect of adding or subtracting 0. This establishes addition and subtraction as related operations.<br><br>\nPupils combine and increase numbers, counting forwards and backwards.<br><br>\nThey discuss and solve problems in familiar practical contexts, including using quantities. Problems should include the terms: put together, add, altogether, total, take away, distance between, difference between, more than and less than, so that pupils develop the concept of addition and subtraction and are enabled to use these operations flexibly.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---multiplication-and-division\">Number - multiplication and division</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>solve one-step problems involving multiplication and division, by calculating the answer using concrete objects, pictorial representations and arrays with the support of the teacher</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Through grouping and sharing small quantities, pupils begin to understand: multiplication and division; doubling numbers and quantities; and finding simple fractions of objects, numbers and quantities.<br><br>\nThey make connections between arrays, number patterns, and counting in 2s, 5s and 10s.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---fractions\">Number - fractions</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>recognise, find and name a half as 1 of 2 equal parts of an object, shape or quantity</li>\n  <li>recognise, find and name a quarter as 1 of 4 equal parts of an object, shape or quantity</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils are taught half and quarter as ‘fractions of’ discrete and continuous quantities by solving problems using shapes, objects and quantities.

They count in multiples of 3 to support their later understanding of a third.<br><br>\nAs they become more confident with numbers up to 100, pupils are introduced to larger numbers to develop further their recognition of patterns within the number system and represent them in different ways, including spatial representations.<br><br>\nPupils should partition numbers in different ways (for example, 23 = 20 + 3 and 23 = 10 + 13) to support subtraction. They become fluent and apply their knowledge of numbers to reason with, discuss and solve problems that emphasise the value of each digit in two-digit numbers. They begin to understand 0 as a place holder.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---addition-and-subtraction-1\">Number - addition and subtraction</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>solve problems with addition and subtraction: \n    <ul>\n<li>using concrete objects and pictorial representations, including those involving numbers, quantities and measures</li>\n      <li>applying their increasing knowledge of mental and written methods </li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n  <li>recall and use addition and subtraction facts to 20 fluently, and derive and use related facts up to 100</li>\n  <li>add and subtract numbers using concrete objects, pictorial representations, and mentally, including:\n    <ul>\n<li>a two-digit number and 1s</li>\n      <li>a two-digit number and 10s</li>\n      <li>2 two-digit numbers</li>\n      <li>adding 3 one-digit numbers</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n  <li>show that addition of 2 numbers can be done in any order (commutative) and subtraction of 1 number from another cannot </li>\n  <li>recognise and use the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction and use this to check calculations and solve missing number problems</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils extend their understanding of the language of addition and subtraction to include sum and difference.<br><br>\nPupils practise addition and subtraction to 20 to become increasingly fluent in deriving facts such as using 3 + 7 = 10; 10 − 7 = 3 and 7 = 10 − 3 to calculate 30 + 70 = 100; 100 − 70 = 30 and 70 = 100 − 30. They check their calculations, including by adding to check subtraction and adding numbers in a different order to check addition (for example, 5 + 2 + 1 = 1 + 5 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 5).

They practise to become fluent in the 2, 5 and 10 multiplication tables and connect them to each other. They connect the 10 multiplication table to place value, and the 5 multiplication table to the divisions on the clock face. They begin to use other multiplication tables and recall multiplication facts, including using related division facts to perform written and mental calculations.<br><br>\nPupils work with a range of materials and contexts in which multiplication and division relate to grouping and sharing discrete and continuous quantities, to arrays and to repeated addition. They begin to relate these to fractions and measures (for example, 40 ÷ 2 = 20, 20 is a half of 40). They use commutativity and inverse relations to develop multiplicative reasoning (for example, 4 × 5 = 20 and 20 ÷ 5 = 4).</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---fractions-1\">Number - fractions</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>recognise, find, name and write fractions <span class=\"fraction\">\n  <img alt=\"1/3\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/assets/fractions/1_3-9003d7f3d7cd4433647a5f6525aa7eda.png\"></span>\n, <span class=\"fraction\">\n  <img alt=\"1/4\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/assets/fractions/1_4-b6128849c8da3b46b9cb5a6918cfe084.png\"></span>\n, <span class=\"fraction\">\n  <img alt=\"2/4\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/assets/fractions/2_4-e071530a44f0d7980f3442c23e3edd3b.png\"></span>\n and <span class=\"fraction\">\n  <img alt=\"3/4\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/assets/fractions/3_4-cded12d0389211f864dcb27e640c64d4.png\"></span>\n of a length, shape, set of objects or quantity</li>\n  <li>write simple fractions, for example <span class=\"fraction\">\n  <img alt=\"1/2\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/assets/fractions/1_2-6e6f542bec97cb8ea3acf39cd25690ee.png\"></span>\n of 6 = 3 and recognise the equivalence of <span class=\"fraction\">\n  <img alt=\"2/4\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/assets/fractions/2_4-e071530a44f0d7980f3442c23e3edd3b.png\"></span>\nand <span class=\"fraction\">\n  <img alt=\"1/2\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/assets/fractions/1_2-6e6f542bec97cb8ea3acf39cd25690ee.png\"></span>\n</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils use fractions as ‘fractions of’ discrete and continuous quantities by solving problems using shapes, objects and quantities.
