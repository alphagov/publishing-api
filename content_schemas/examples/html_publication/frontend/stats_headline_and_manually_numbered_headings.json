amount of benefits a household can receive out-of-work to £23,000 in Greater London and to £20,000 for residents elsewhere (with exemptions to protect the most vulnerable)</li>\n  <li>ensuring 18 to 21 year olds, who are out of work, no longer have automatic entitlement to support with housing costs from April 2017 (with exemptions to protect the most vulnerable)</li>\n  <li>freezing the rates of working age benefits and tax credits for 4 years from April 2016 (with exemptions to protect the most vulnerable)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>taking action to manage expenditure within the welfare cap </li>\n  <li>further reforming welfare rules so that European Union jobseekers can no longer access UK means-tested benefits (from June 2015 we have ended European Union jobseekers’ entitlement to Universal Credit)</li>\n  <li>reducing immigration by cutting the benefits European Union migrants get so we prevent the welfare system acting as a magnet and create a fairer system for people who work hard and play by the rules </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are supporting disabled people to live independently by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Replacing Disability Living Allowance with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pip\">Personal Independence Payment</a> (<abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr>). We have introduced Personal Independence Payment, which is designed to better reflect today’s understanding of disability, particularly on mental health and fluctuating conditions, and to focus support on those in greatest need. Personal Independence Payment is exempt from the benefit freeze over the life of the Parliament and is also exempt from the benefit cap</li>\n  <li>paying disability and carers’ benefits (£23.1 billion in financial year 2014 to 2015)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are improving the life chances of children and of adults by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>developing a Life Chances Strategy, which will set out a comprehensive plan to fight disadvantage and extend opportunity so that every child can reach their full potential</li>\n  <li>introducing new life chances measures on worklessness and educational attainment, along with other measures of the root causes of poverty including, family stability, drug and alcohol dependency and financial stability </li>\n  <li>encouraging family stability, by improving the availability of support for couples (we will spend over £70 million this Parliament, exceeding the manifesto commitment to invest at least £7.5 million in relationship support), developing a significantly expanded parenting programme, and implementing reforms to the Child Maintenance Service to encourage family based arrangements where appropriate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are working closely with all the nations within the UK, in particular where areas of policy are closely linked, and particularly with the Scottish government on how newly devolved powers will work in practice, as part of this we are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>working with the Scotland Office to implement recommendations of the Smith Commission relating to <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> policy through delivery of the Scotland Bill, which includes devolving powers to the Scottish government to deliver a range of benefits and employment support</li>\n  <li>supporting the principle of localism, working with local authorities, community groups and charities to join up delivery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-dwp-is-doing-2\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.2 </span> How <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> is doing</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"forecast-welfare-spending-within-the-welfare-cap\">Forecast welfare spending within the welfare cap</h3>\n\n<p>As required under the Charter for Budget Responsibility, the welfare cap was reset for this Parliament at the July 2015 Budget, where the government set it at the Office for Budget Responsibility’s post-measures forecast. This locked in a reduction in the level of the cap compared with Autumn Statement 2014 that reached £16.3 billion by financial year 2019 to 2020. </p>\n\n<p>The Office for Budget Responsibility assessment at Autumn Statement 2015 was that the welfare cap will be met in financial year 2019 to 2020 and financial year 2020 to 2021, although not in earlier years. This was because the government gave families longer to adjust to the higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare society. </p>\n\n<p>In financial year 2016 to 2017, more than a third of spending within the welfare cap will be administered by other government departments. This share will gradually reduce as Universal Credit (administered by <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr>) replaces tax credits (administered by HM Revenue and Customs), though around 14% of capped spending will continue to be outside direct Department for Work and Pensions control in the longer term. </p>\n\n<aside class=\"stat-headline\">\n<p>Percentage of children living in workless households\n<em>11.8%</em>\nin April to June 2015</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>In April to June 2015 11.8% of children were living in a workless household an improvement from 16.2% in the same quarter in 2010. </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lmac/working-and-workless-households/index.html\">The Household Labour Force Survey.</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"deliver-outstanding-services-to-our-customers-and-claimants\">\n<span class=\"number\">4. </span> Deliver outstanding services to our customers and claimants</h2>\n\n<p>Lead minister: <a href=\"/government/people/lord-freud\">Lord Freud, Minister of State for Welfare Reform</a></p>\n\n<p>Lead official: <a href=\"/government/people/noel-shanahan\">Noel Shanahan, Director General, Operations</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-dwp-is-doing-3\">\n<span class=\"number\">4.1 </span> What <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> is doing</h3>\n\n<p>We deliver essential services for welfare, pensions and child maintenance.
