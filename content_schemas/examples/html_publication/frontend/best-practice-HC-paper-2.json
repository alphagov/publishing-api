From live web chats to a dedicated online portal for reporting medical conditions, the last year has seen us develop more responsive and tailored services online.</p>\n\n<p>As one of the largest employers in South Wales we’re committed to playing a significant role in the community. Throughout the year we’ve supported employment initiatives and offered work placement opportunities to local people.</p>\n\n<p>We also became Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) Ambassadors for the area and supported local primary schools to engage young people in technology through ‘code club’ sessions.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016-17 we were awarded Investors in People silver accreditation and successfully retained our silver award in the Corporate Health Standard accreditation scheme. We’ve continued to drive for a diverse workforce, that reflects the customers and communities we serve and has the right attitudes, behaviours and skills to deliver and improve our services.</p>\n\n<p>I’m proud of what we’ve achieved over the past year, ultimately providing customers with simpler, better and more secure ways of transacting with us.  These achievements would not have been possible without the talents and hard work of our staff.</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead and to working together with our Board and staff in delivering our Strategic Plan for 2017-20.</p>\n\n<p>Lesley Cowley OBE<br>\nNon-Executive Chair<br>\n28 June 2017</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"chief-executives-message\">Chief Executive’s message</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/63969/Oliver_Morley_03.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Morley\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>This last year has been one of significant achievement for the Agency. We completed our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-3-year-strategic-plan\">Strategic Plan 2014-17</a> whilst delivering our core responsibilities, we were also recognised on a national level for our digital services.</p>\n\n<p>The previous 3 years have been very much about transforming our services and business. We’ve focused on providing excellent online services, hand-in-hand with other channels and recognising opportunities to continuously improve these, delivering best in class customer services.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is clear and it is what drives us every day - to get the right drivers and vehicles on the road as simply, safely and efficiently as possible.</p>\n\n<p>2016-17 was an exceptional year for our digital services, which were recognised at the Digital Leaders Top 100 awards where among other accolades we won the overall prize of Digital Leaders 100 Award.</p>\n\n<p>During the year we:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Made our systems ready for the new vehicle tax rates which came into force on 1 April 2017. This was a huge piece of work which involved working closely with vehicle manufacturers and dealers to make sure that new cars could be registered and licensed without delay.</li>\n  <li>Introduced a new online service allowing customers to tell us they have a medical condition. This service has helped provide quicker decisions to customers.</li>\n  <li>Exceeded our efficiency target of 14%, achieving an 18% reduction, equating to around £45 million cost savings. Revenues paid over to HM Treasury increased by 23%, contributing £201.6m to the Exchequer. Our net income for the year represents 20% of total income, a significant improvement on the 10% reported last year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Last year was not without its challenges.  A Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman’s investigation into our Drivers Medical Group highlighted the need for improvements in the way we manage medical cases. We apologised to customers affected and continued to make improvements.</p>\n\n<p>Our achievements have been possible due to the dedication and passion of <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> staff. My thanks go to the commitment and support of my Executive team and the hard work of our staff for getting us to where we are today.</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward, our new <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-strategic-plan-2017-to-2020\">Strategic Plan 2017-20</a> focuses on 5 key areas: best-in-class customer services; dynamic technology and services; hub for digital motoring; modern workplace; unrivalled safety, security and compliance.</p>\n\n<p>We’re looking forward to taking the opportunities offered by cloud services, agile methodology and our recently in-sourced IT to continue to build dynamic technology and services that respond to changing customer demand. Motoring technology is changing fast, and our commitment to innovation and excellent customer-service will enable us to become a hub for digital motoring.</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to the year ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Oliver Morley CBE<br>\nAccounting Officer and Chief Executive, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr><br>\n28 June 2017</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"highlights-for-the-year\">Highlights for the year</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64926/Highlights_1.jpg\" alt=\"Highlights for the year\"></div></figure>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64927/Highlights_2.jpg\" alt=\"Highlights for the year\"></div></figure>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64928/Highlights_3.jpg\" alt=\"Highlights for the year\"></div></figure>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64929/Highlights_4.jpg\" alt=\"Highlights for the year\"></div></figure>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64930/Highlights_5.jpg\" alt=\"Highlights for the year\"></div></figure>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64993/Highlights_6.jpg\" alt=\"Highlights for the year\"></div></figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-we-are-and-what-we-do\">\n<span class=\"number\">1. </span> Who we are and what we do</h2>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> is an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport and is part of the DfT Roads, Devolution and Motoring Group.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to get the right drivers and vehicles taxed and on the road, as simply, safely and efficiently as possible.</p>\n\n<p>We maintain the registration and licensing of over 47 million drivers in Great Britain and the registration of over 39 million vehicles, together with the collection and enforcement of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> in the UK.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"our-services\">Our services</h4>\n\n<p>Our award winning digital services provide the public with a simpler, better and more secure way of transacting with us.

The scheme has raised over £2.4 billion since it started in 1989.</p>\n\n<p>During the year, we continued to work closely with our stakeholders to ensure that our services were tailored accordingly.

Working in collaboration with Swansea University, we have played a big part in becoming Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) Ambassadors for the area. We have presented at festivals and road shows to demonstrate how ‘computational thinking’ is a skill and how it can help young people to transfer these skills into the workplace.</p>\n\n<p>We have continued our relationship with Swansea Techhub which led to a move into the new building in 2016. Our new sponsored event space named Furnace has become a home for the tech community which can be used for workshops, meetings, conferences and hackathons.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/65422/Alzheimers_collection_photograph.jpg\" alt=\"Alzheimers collection photograph\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>Our staff chose the Alzheimer’s Society as its charity of choice for 2016.

We have also made changes to the first registration service to capture the list price of the vehicle, so that the appropriate rate is charged.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the new <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> rates visit our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-vehicle-tax-rates-from-1-april-2017\">website</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tell-dvla-about-a-medical-condition-that-could-affect-your-driving\">Tell <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> about a medical condition that could affect your driving</h4>\n\n<p>We currently deal with approximately 660,000 paper based medical transactions each year. In August 2016, we introduced a new online service to allow drivers with car and motorcycle entitlement to tell us about a medical condition that may affect their driving. Drivers can currently use the service to tell us about  diabetes, vision, epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, certain heart conditions, sleep apnoea and narcolepsy. We have also introduced an online service to allow drivers with similar medical conditions and criteria to renew their short term medical driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Our online services provide instant advice to the user, meeting their needs until a licensing decision is made. Due to the efficiencies of the online services  we can now provide quicker decisions to  users, aiding road safety.</p>\n\n<p>For more information visit our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/report-driving-medical-condition\">website</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"contact-centre-modernisation\">Contact centre modernisation</h4>\n<p>We have a responsibility to provide excellent services and value for money to the public. Our contact centre receives around 7.8 million driver licence enquiries and 17.3 million vehicle enquiries a year.</p>\n\n<p>Our contact centre is currently undergoing a modernisation programme, with the potential to be a ‘Centre of Excellence’ in Government. Our contact centre will have the ability to provide services across departments and the public sector.</p>\n\n<p>We have been successful in achieving high level industry recognised awards over the last 10 years. We have achieved the prestigious accreditation to the Customer Contact Association (<abbr title=\"Customer Contact Association\">CCA</abbr>) new Global Standard 6 award in 2016-17.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, a new improved email solution was introduced. Customers can now make an enquiry through an online web form and receive an answer from an advisor or automatic email response. This approach significantly improves the customer journey when contacting us by email.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the delivery of the new email service, we have developed an internal knowledge database for advisors, it provides quick access to the information they need to answer the customer’s enquiry.</p>\n\n<p>During the year, we introduced a new speech analytics solution. This solution provides insight around call demand and has improved both the services we offer and the customer experience. This also helps reduce call demand and provides a more efficient telephone service for our customers.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, we introduced a new webchat service, it provides online support to our customers on personalised registration, view driving licence and electronic vehicle licensing services. Webchat provides real- time support for customers who are trying to transact through these services. Since the service has been introduced the number of customers using the service has increased from 3,000 to 25,000 a month.  91% of our customers are satisfied with the service.</p>\n\n<p>Our contact centre uses social media to answer customer enquiries, receiving over 14,000 enquiries a year. This is supported by the introduction of a social media marketing and analytical tool, which provides a greater understanding around the effectiveness of any social media campaigns. This tool also helps to identify whether new initiatives are being communicated and understood on our social media channels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"our-services-1\">Our services</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"ved-collection\">\n<abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> collection</h4>\n\n<p>We collect around £6 billion in <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> each year. <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> compliance is high, largely due to the convenience and simplicity of our online services. In 2015, the DfT Roadside Survey on <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> estimated that 1.4% of vehicles were unlicensed.</p>\n\n<p>Although this reflects that the vast majority of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> is collected, we did see some change in customer behaviour following the abolition of the tax disc and the rules around non-transferability of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>. As a result we refreshed our approach to compliance and enforcement and developed a strategy which makes <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> even easier to pay and harder to evade.</p>\n\n<p>In September 2016, HM Treasury, DfT and <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> agreed a strategy to reduce evasion. The recommendations are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>reduce evasion to under 1% by 2019 and show an improvement by 2017</li>\n  <li>carry out a DfT roadside survey in June 2017 (reporting findings in November 2017)</li>\n  <li>create an enforcement approach that is sustainable, efficient and delivers a digital service wherever possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will continue to introduce new online services to ensure that we make it easier for customers to comply with the law. In 2016 we introduced a facility for customers to pay enforcement penalties online. This supports the government’s digital agenda, making it easier for customers to use our services. For more information, visit our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pay-dvla-fine\">website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017-18 we will be increasing the range of penalties payable through our online services. For more information about our enforcement strategy see our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-strategic-plan-2017-to-2020\">Strategic Plan 2017-20</a> and \n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-business-plan-2017-to-2018\">Business Plan 2017-18</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"digital-services\">Digital services</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/65423/Online_Services_05.jpg\" alt=\"Digital services\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>We have continued to focus on providing excellent online services to our customers, building new and innovative digital services and laying the foundation for new technology.</p>\n\n<p>To meet customer expectations and provide a service that meets their needs, our online service is available 24/7. In 2016-17 take up of our digital and automated transactions increased to 96.2%.</p>\n\n<p>We have gained an impressive list of accomplishments over the last year, winning the prestigious Digital Leaders Top 100 Awards for our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence\">share driving licence</a> service. We received the Digital Public Service Innovation of the Year Award which honours the highest achievements of the year, for teams and individuals from the private and public sector.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next 3 years we will further transform our IT and services. We will become a hub for digital motoring, removing paper and documents where we can with digital options. We will provide interactive software to allow business and government to develop new services on top of ours.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"drivers-medical\">Drivers medical</h4>\n\n<p>Our drivers’ medical department deals with all aspects of driver licensing when there are medical conditions that could affect safe control of a vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>We operate under national medical guidelines on fitness to drive that we have published on our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessing-fitness-to-drive-a-guide-for-medical-professionals\">website</a>. The guidance is intended to assist doctors and other healthcare professionals in advising their patients:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>whether or not we require notification of a medical condition</li>\n  <li>what the licensing outcome from our medical enquiries is likely to be.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In 2016-17, we recruited and trained over 100 staff to be able to investigate and process a wider range of notifiable medical conditions. To increase the resource dedicated to deal with the more complex cases, we ran recruitment campaigns for qualified and experienced doctors and nurses. In 2016-17, 4 doctors and 3 casework nurses joined the agency. In addition to this up to 8 doctors and additional nurses will join the agency in 2017-18.</p>\n\n<p>Additional resource has had a significant impact in improving the levels of drivers’ medical customer service. In 2016-17 a medical licensing decision was made in 92.3% of cases within 90 days compared to 84.4% in 2015-16. In 2016-17, the average number of days taken to make a decision on fitness to drive was 37 days compared to 55 in 2015-16.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout 2016-17, we have worked on a range of initiatives to continually improve the drivers’ medical service, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>extending medical licences for specific conditions (for example diabetes and Parkinson’s disease) from 3 years to 5 years</li>\n  <li>launching and updating the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessing-fitness-to-drive-a-guide-for-medical-professionals\">Assessing Fitness to Drive</a> guidance</li>\n  <li>reviewing customer facing letters</li>\n  <li>streamlining internal process to support a quicker licensing decision without compromising medical standards.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"customer-service-standards\">Customer service standards</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/65485/Contact_Centre_03.jpg\" alt=\"Contact Centre\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>We are committed to delivering excellent services to our customers. We work closely with a wide range of customers to ensure that we provide a service that they expect. In 2016-17, we exceeded all of our customer service standards.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about our service standards visit our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency/about/about-our-services\">website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"meeting-customer-needs\">Meeting customer needs</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"customer-service-excellence\">Customer Service Excellence</h4>\n\n<p>Customer service and satisfaction is pivotal to what we do.

Our UX@<abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> is one of the best user experience testing labs in the country. The UX lab gives us detailed feedback to help us improve our services further.</p>\n\n<p>We also conducted a number of different research projects to support the development of new and existing online services. This ensures that our customers are at the heart of service development.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Customer satisfaction  measure</th>\n      <th>Target</th>\n      <th>Result</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>I want to tax my vehicle</td>\n      <td>95%</td>\n      <td>96.1%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>I want to amend my vehicle registration details</td>\n      <td>90%</td>\n      <td>90.9%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>I want to renew my driving licence</td>\n      <td>93%</td>\n      <td>95.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Drivers medical transactions</td>\n      <td>77%</td>\n      <td>83.9%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h4 id=\"customer-complaints\">Customer complaints</h4>\n\n<p>In 2016-17 the number of overall customer complaints reduced by 13.8% compared to 6.5% in 2015-16.</p>\n\n<p>Both driver and vehicle complaints have seen a considerable decrease of 17% and 24% respectively, which exceeds the 5% reduction target. These have been achieved through the continued development and continuous improvement to processes and online services that have had a positive impact on customers dealing with the agency.</p>\n\n<p>Drivers’ medical complaints has increased during the period by 4%. While this clearly fails the reduction target, complaint volumes account for only 0.14% of case volumes. This may have increased due to media interest. To address this, additional resource was introduced and combined with process enhancements, has led to improved performance with substantially more cases closured.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"corporate-customers\">Corporate customers</h4>\n<p>We have continued to deliver and improve services that meet the business needs of our corporate customers. During the year, we worked closely with our corporate customers, continuously improving our services through customer insight and feedback. Results of the 2016 survey showed that 94% of our corporate customers were happy with our service.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vehicle-tax-ved-changes-setting-the-scene-for-motor-industry\"><abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> reform</a> – we formed and chaired an Industry Steering Group to ensure that the motor industry had all the information they required in preparation for <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> reform. This group supported and informed the development of the services that supported the changes. Early and regular engagement with the industry on <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> reform implementation was well received. We hosted workshops and webinars to increase understanding across the industry. This has enabled early cascade and feedback channels to obtain clarity for smooth implementation.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-vocational-drivers\">Vocational driver guide</a> – this was an excellent example of collaborative working between DfT, the Traffic Commissioner for Wales and the trade associations from the passenger transport and haulage industry. Our work with corporate customers helped inform drivers of the complex rules and regulations around driving lorries and buses.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assessing-fitness-to-drive-a-guide-for-medical-professionals\">Fitness to Drive</a> – our collaboration with charities and motoring organisations throughout the year has resulted in them supporting our digital driver service developments and communications. It has also improved mutual understanding of the issues affecting both the charities and our customers.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/dvla-fleet-vehicle-info\">Fleet companies</a> – corporate customers who operate large fleets of vehicles have benefitted from the introduction of new services through our fleet scheme. This allows operators to better organise and manage compliance in their fleets.</p>\n\n<p>We hosted and visited trade associations, motoring organisations, charities and police forces during the year. This has provided the opportunity to showcase the benefits and efficiencies of our digital services.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"business-development\">Business development</h4>\n\n<p>We have an experienced and cost-efficient workforce with a wide mix of skills. We want to make the best use of these opportunities as a service provider both for government and the private sector. Our aim is to use our assets to build new revenue and transactional opportunities across government using our own commercial enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>During the year, we continued to build on cross-government working, securing work to produce 14.5 million annual tax summaries for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>\n\n<p>We also carried out a 6 month pilot with Highways England, issuing warning letters to drivers using <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/red-x-means-dont-drive-in-that-lane\">Red X lanes</a> or who drive on the hard shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2016, we launched a new workplace charge point grant scheme for the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-low-emission-vehicles\">Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV)</a> and are working towards designing a single online portal to facilitate a further 3 grant schemes in 2017-18.</p>\n\n<p>This has been a successful year for our personalised registration scheme. During the year we:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>launched  the 66 and 17 new series registrations</li>\n  <li>introduced some P prefix registrations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our auction programme of selling older style registrations achieved over £22 million.</p>\n\n<p>We also continued to introduce new Northern Ireland format registrations for sale on our website and at auction which raised £1.9 million (£1.4 million in 2015-16). The total overall revenue raised for 2016-17 was £114.0 million (£102.2million in 2015-16).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-responsibilities\">Financial responsibilities</h3>\n\n<p>Our accounts are made up of the Business Account and the Trust Statement.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"business-account\">Business Account</h4>\n\n<p>The Business Account is segmented into:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>maintenance of the driver and vehicle database and related services</li>\n  <li>sale of personalised registrations, which represents commercial income generated directly from the public. We retain income to recover our costs in administering personalised registrations services with the excess paid to HM Treasury as Consolidated Fund extra receipts</li>\n  <li>collection and enforcement of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> including enforcement recoveries (the income stream from the collection of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> is accounted for in the Trust Statement)</li>\n  <li>services delivered to other government departments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"financial-results\">Financial results</h4>\n\n<p>Our total income for the year was £564 million against £541 million in 2015-16. An increase of £23 million is due to a number of variances, the key increase being due to the sale and transfer of personalised registrations marks.</p>\n\n<p>Our total expenditure for the year was £451 million against £485 million in 2015-16. The reduction of £34 million is mainly due to the decrease in IT costs following PACT exit in 2015-16.</p>\n\n<p>Net income for the year has increased from 10% of total income in 2015-16 to 20% in 2016-17.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"departmental-expenditure-limit\">Departmental Expenditure Limit</h4>\n\n<p>As a government body, we have budgets set at the start of the financial year in respect of our Business Account activities. The resource (RDEL) out-turn for the year is £91 million, £22 million under our original settlement for the year.  This reduction results from the increased income and reduced expenditure.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"trust-statement\">Trust Statement</h4>\n\n<p>Our Trust Statement details the revenue in respect of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>, fines and penalties and HGV levy falling outside of the boundary of our Business Account.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"financial-results-1\">Financial results</h4>\n\n<p>During the year the Trust Statement gross revenue amounted to over £6 billion.</p>\n\n<p>The net cost of collecting <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> and the enforcement action taken as a result of non-compliance (brought to account in the Business Account) was £119 million, a decrease of £18 million when compared to expenditure in 2015-16. This is £12 million less than our 2016-17 business plan measure (<abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> collection and enforcement expenditure will not exceed £131 million). The overall reduction is due to efficiencies which more than off-set the £4.2 million increase in the direct cost of wheelclamping.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"efficiency\">Efficiency</h4>\n\n<p>The Spending Review 2015 committed us to make a 14% resource budget reduction by 31 March 2017 in comparison to the 2015-16 baseline (34% total reduction by 31 March 2020).  We have exceeded the target by achieving a 18% reduction.</p>\n\n<p>In total, we have reduced costs by £45 million (unadjusted for inflation) against the baseline, through:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>realising the benefits of moving away from a large IT contract and bringing IT services in-house. These include removing over 60% of our hardware/software contracts and challenging contractor rates to drive savings</li>\n  <li>introducing new online services and increasing take-up of existing services which has resulted in reduced intermediary and consumables costs</li>\n  <li>commercial efficiencies through negotiating reduced unit prices, achieving economies of scale and challenging requirements to reduce contract costs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"sustainability\">Sustainability</h4>\n\n<p>In 2016 the Greening Government Commitments (GGC) were revised as 3 year targets, ranging from 2016-17 to 2019-20, set against the original baseline of 2009-10. They continue to focus on greenhouse gas emissions, waste, water and paper. More details of the new commitments can be found on GOV.UK.</p>\n\n<p>We have exceeded all but 1 of our ambitions for the year including reducing carbon emissions by a further 2% currently at 36% less than 2009-10.

We achieved a 70% reduction of emissions from business travel against the 2009-10 baseline. Although this is a good result, we have increased emissions from business travel by 12.3% compared to last year.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of the increase in business travel has been identified as the result of our IT transformation and the in-housing of our IT services. Some travel, previously undertaken by IT contractors is now carried out by our staff.</p>\n\n<p>The remainder of the increase is largely attributed to the recent purchase of 3 further Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) fleet cars. This has increased mileage by 20% but will allow for additional road side identification of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> evasion.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"total-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64852/Total-greenhouse-gas-emissions.jpg\" alt=\"Total greenhouse gas emissions\"></div></figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"waste\">Waste</h4>\n\n<p>The GGC target requires us to reduce the amount of waste created year on year and increase the amount recycled to ensure that we send less than 10% of that waste to landfill.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016-17 we created 52% less waste than the baseline 2009-10. This equated to an 7.5% reduction during the year, compared to 2015-16.</p>\n\n<p>The main contributing factor was a reduction in paper waste, which reduced by just under 85 tonnes. General waste also reduced by over 20 tonnes, both of which are around a usual month’s total. Our reduction in paper demonstrates the continued benefits realised from the digitalisation of our services. In addition, operational activities to reduce paper waste include the work of our printing facilities to reuse end of operational paper reels to feed smaller batches of work.</p>\n\n<p>Of the 1060 tonnes of waste created, just 6% was sent to landfill, 71.5% was recycled or reused and the remainder was incinerated for energy.</p>\n\n<p>During 2016-17 we continued to divert nearly 600 items that were at the end of their useful life away from becoming waste. This was due to significant changes in process or technology refresh, had little financial value but could be of use to others. These items, such as paper, operational stationery, IT equipment and furniture, wherever possible, were found new homes in local schools, charities or local government organisations.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"water\">Water</h4>\n\n<p>We have committed to continue to reduce total water consumption from 2014-15 levels by 2019-20.<br><br>During 2016-17 we achieved a 4% reduction.</p>\n\n<p>This has been achieved through increased monitoring of sub-meters leading to the prompt resolve of any leaks and allows the identification of wasteful processes. As we have redefined what is considered as office accommodation throughout our estate we have increased the level of m3 per full time equivalent employee from 4m3 to 7.7m3.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"procurement\">Procurement</h4>\n\n<p>We recognise the impact that our procurement decisions have on our sustainability outcomes. We successfully achieved the <abbr title=\"Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply\">CIPS</abbr> accreditation which demonstrates our compliant policies, processes and practices, which includes a sustainability agenda, against the accreditation standard.</p>\n\n<p>We are represented on the government-wide sustainable procurement group and continue to be committed to meeting the Government Buying Standards (GBS) best practice specifications wherever possible.</p>\n\n<p>During 2016-2017, we established a sustainability action log to identify process/organisational improvements and provide key delivery milestones and timescales.</p>\n\n<p>We have increased the level of awareness of our commercial staff relating to sustainability within the procurement process through:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>mandated product knowledge sessions to commercial advisors</li>\n  <li>senior management attendance at external sustainable procurement courses</li>\n  <li>mandated sustainability module for commercial advisors undertaking <abbr title=\"Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply\">CIPS</abbr> Level 5 examinations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"transparency-commitments\">Transparency commitments</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Climate change adaptation</td>\n      <td>One of our properties is at risk of flooding.

The latest review was undertaken in December 2016. The review concluded there were no significant issues to address, and provided evidence of the growing maturity and effectiveness of the board, a view supported by external stakeholders. As in previous years the board has agreed a number of continuous improvement activities in the areas of strategic planning and development and external stakeholder engagement.</p>\n\n<p>As Chief Executive, my role is to formally agree specific targets and success criteria with each ET member at the start of each year, directly from our published business plan and I review progress against these objectives with them at face-to-face monthly meetings.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"remuneration-committee\">Remuneration committee</h4>\n\n<p>The role of the remuneration committee is to make recommendations to DfT and myself on all aspects of remuneration decisions for our ET (including the Chief Executive) in accordance with current pay guidance and with particular regard to equal opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>It also considers the wider talent in the organisation and ensures visibility in respect of potential successors into agency senior civil service positions.</p>\n\n<p>The Committee will normally meet once a year in February, but may do so more often if necessary, at the discretion of the Chair.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"audit-and-risk-committee\">Audit and Risk Committee</h4>\n<p>Our Audit and Risk Committee has formally agreed terms of reference which are reviewed on an annual basis. The Committee provides advice and support to the Chief Executive in discharging the responsibilities of our Accounting Officer.</p>\n\n<p>The Audit and Risk Committee is comprised of 3 Non-Executive Directors and 2 independent members who are Senior Civil Servants (SCS) in other Government Departments. The members are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Jeremy Boss, Audit and Risk Committee Chair (appointed January 2016)</li>\n  <li>Christopher Morson (appointed October 2013 and re-appointed in October 2016)</li>\n  <li>Emma West (appointed November 2014)</li>\n  <li>Paul Rodgers, accountancy and commercial operations (DfT SCS appointed October 2012)</li>\n  <li>Sarah Scullion, human resources (<abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> SCS appointed June 2013 retired June 2016)</li>\n  <li>Helen John, sponsorship of arm’s length bodies and finance (<abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> SCS appointed October 2016)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I attend along with the Finance Director and Head of Internal Audit as observers; National Audit Office and KPMG as sub-contracted auditors to National Audit Office. Other ET members attend as observers by rotation and when the committee has asked to discuss matters for which they are accountable. Representatives of DfT Finance have a standing invitation to attend every meeting.</p>\n\n<p>The Audit and Risk Committee has access to all internal audit reports, major project assurance reports, external reviews, risk registers and management reports. The agenda follows a cyclical pattern for external reporting but consider the following at each of their 4 meetings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>progress against assurance plans; adequacy of response to the risk register and that correct risks have been identified</li>\n  <li>management responses and action progress against assurance reviews</li>\n  <li>response to fraud and bribery threats</li>\n  <li>ICT security and any breaches reported.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Audit and Risk Committee challenges and approves the agency Management Assurance Statement and the Annual Report and Accounts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"wider-governance\">Wider governance</h4>\n\n<p>DfT Sponsor helps ensure sufficient priority is afforded to operational delivery, progress towards business plan performance measures and the management of risk through regular challenge meetings with myself and the Finance Director.</p>\n\n<p>We contribute monthly to DfT transparency reporting on progress towards financial targets and cash forecasting, expenditure and contracts in respect of our own activities. Our reports, together with emerging escalated risks and issues, are aggregated with those of other agencies and considered at DfT Executive Committee and Group Audit and Risk Committee as appropriate.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"managing-our-risks\">Managing our risks</h4>\n<p>Our risk policy is updated on an annual basis to ensure the risk management framework and approach to risk appetite is appropriately defined and remains effective. The current agency risk policy is published on our internal intranet site and remains aligned to the overarching DfT policy.</p>\n\n<p>Risks are identified and managed at several levels and captured on a standard reporting template. There is an established process for escalating risks to the Corporate Risk Register which is reviewed by the Executive Team on a monthly basis and quarterly by our board and our Audit and Risk Committee.</p>\n\n<p>The ET and board consider potential new risks that we face on an ongoing basis. A specific risk identification exercise was undertaken in August 2016 identifying risks to be included on the Corporate Risk Register.</p>\n\n<p>The main risks at the 2016-17 year end included a number of inherent risks that we will always need to monitor. Such risks include ensuring robust business continuity plans are in place to address a range of potential disruptive scenarios; and the ongoing risks based around resource and resilience.</p>\n\n<p>We have a continuous focus on the security and integrity of the data and information for which we are responsible. The Data Governance Board (DGB) provides the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) and through the SIRO, the board with the necessary assurances in relation to the data and information for which we hold responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>Significant risks are escalated as appropriate to DfT in accordance with requirements set by the Department and HM Treasury.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"managing-the-business--change-and-investment\">Managing the business – change and investment</h4>\n\n<p>We manage the introduction of change through the strategic pipeline along with assignment of strategic priority. The key features of this process are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a rolling pipeline of planned change including projects, contracts, business as usual and business development activities</li>\n  <li>a fortnightly Change Board consisting of the ET and representatives from business, finance and Information Technology Services (ITS), which acts as the first decision making forum in the pipeline process</li>\n  <li>a fortnightly Business Impact Panel (BIP) consisting of representatives from across the agency. This panel assesses the potential impact of any change and allocates up to £50k funding to initiate discovery work and validate the scope of any change, agree requirements and consider options for delivery. The outcome of the discovery enables investment decision making</li>\n  <li>our business case process determines the appropriate governance route for each investment. A 3-stage business case process (following HM Treasury Green Book guidance) is undertaken for changes with a lifecycle cost greater than £1 million with smaller value investments requiring a cost benefits analysis</li>\n  <li>all business cases are subject to internal specialist review and approval, prior to approval at the appropriate investment board, depending on value (for example, programme, Executive Team, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> Agency Board).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64854/Governance-model.jpg\" alt=\"Governance model\"></div></figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"cabinet-office-spending-controls\">Cabinet Office spending controls</h4>\n\n<p>In addition to the rules set out in Managing Public Money, Cabinet Office operates a set of additional spending controls.</p>\n\n<p>We have worked with DfT and Cabinet Office spend approval teams (for digital and technology spend) to develop and pilot a new and more responsive spend control process. This has been based on our pipeline view of change and an assessment of our governance and controls. The pilot has run in parallel with the existing spend controls process and a positive outcome will enable rollout of the new pipeline approval across all change portfolios through 2017-18. We meet with DfT and Cabinet Office on a monthly basis to review individual projects and assess progress against spend plans, with quarterly assessments also being undertaken by Cabinet Office. This new approach allows DfT and Cabinet Office to concentrate on fewer, but higher profile items. Our change pipeline is key to this process by giving a forward view of change plans.</p>\n\n<p>The Cabinet Office spend controls process requires Ministerial approval for ICT spend over a threshold of £5m. One issue was identified during the year with an element of the overall PACT exit spend not receiving appropriate approval. However, we have an excellent record in this space, being recognised as an exemplar across government, as evidenced by the pilot mentioned above and our very positive record since April 2015 to March 2017, receiving approval for 48 different ICT initiatives with a total value of £168m.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"financial-controls\">Financial controls</h4>\n\n<p>Review of operational budgets and project affordability takes place at the monthly finance ET meeting with confirmation of affordability given by the Finance Director. Budgetary controls are supported by a robust and formal full monthly planning and re-forecasting cycle, monitoring volume and change demand. A summary of the results are reported monthly to our board.</p>\n\n<p>As the Accounting Officer, I hold a letter of Financial Delegation issued by the Permanent Secretary of DfT. I sub-delegate financial delegations to Executive Directors and key finance staff.</p>\n\n<p>Staff who have been allocated a delegation must ensure that they have completed the mandatory training programme and been assessed to ensure competence to fulfil the role.</p>\n\n<p>We have developed and implemented a strategy and framework for the analytical assurance of both business case models and statistic reports. The framework details roles and responsibilities and ensures we enshrine the principles of the Macpherson Review in the day-to-day operation of our business. We ensure a robust body of documentation is available for audit. Analytical assurance statements are produced as standard reflecting best practice. Specialist review sign-off of business cases ensures analytical assurance is undertaken before investment decisions being made. A periodic review is undertaken assessing our organisation’s business models against DfT criteria to establish if the model in question is classified as ‘business critical’. At present we do not have any models classed as ‘business critical’.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"shared-services\">Shared Services</h4>\n\n<p>Since divestment, Shared Services has provided services to DfT and <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>. Commercial discussions with Arvato have been concluded and both platforms are to be maintained with DfT managing the contract directly. This has led to DfT being in control of ensuring continuity of service; standardisation of process; securing value for money; and its future direction.</p>\n\n<p>As the framework authority, DfT Accounting Officer is now responsible for providing DfT and <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>, with assurance that Independent Shared Service Centre (ISSC) 1 is meeting its contractual obligations. The DfT Accounting Officer is supported in this role by a dedicated Shared Service Audit Committee.</p>\n\n<p>DfT has received an International Standards of Assurance Engagement (ISAE) 3402 report produced by KPMG on Arvato’s operation of the control environment at ISSC1. DfT has also received a number of internal audit reports on ISSC1 risk controls. <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> has placed reliance on these reports for assurance over ISSC1’s control environment during the 2016-17 financial year.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"commercial-controls\">Commercial controls</h4>\n<p>As a central government body, our commercial activity is governed by legislation within the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. Governance and control of commercial activity is administered by the Commercial Directorate and overseen by the Commercial Director.</p>\n\n<p>Our Commercial Directorate is responsible for ensuring that commercial practice is compliant with the regulations. In line with the government’s transparency agenda, all tender opportunities are published, including single tender actions and contracts over £10,000.</p>\n\n<p>The Commercial Directorate has developed Commercial Procedures and a Commercial Policy which act as the 2 primary control documents governing commercial activity.</p>\n\n<p>Contractual authority emanates from me as Accounting Officer and is delegated to individuals in specific posts (primarily Commercial Director, Head of Procurement and senior commercial managers) and is not transferable. Only those with contractual authority are allowed to commit us to any commercial activity. Contractual authority is distinct from financial authority and no individual is permitted to exercise both for the same requirement.</p>\n\n<p>We have developed an efficient and effective practice whereby all contracts are sponsored at ET level. This is supplemented by making day-to-day contract management the shared responsibility of a business owner and a professional Commercial Advisor from within Commercial Directorate; supported by a professional Financial Advisor.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"data-controls\">Data controls</h4>\n<p>The governance arrangements for control of data have not changed significantly. Embedded processes whilst under constant review have proved fit for purpose and are mature.</p>\n\n<p>The SIRO who is also the Director of Strategy, Policy and Communications is accountable for information risk and is supported by a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and Information Asset Owners (IAO’s) the latter being accountable for the day to day control of information.</p>\n\n<p>Data control and risk is co-ordinated through a DGB chaired by the SIRO and attended by subject matter experts from across the organisation. The Chief Executive also attends this board.</p>\n\n<p>There have been 15 incidents of personal data breaches this year which is a decrease from last year (21 in 2015-16). All of these breaches have been low volume and largely attributed to human error, none required reporting to the Information Commissioners’ Office.</p>\n\n<p>The threats to our information from both criminal and other activity are increasing globally. Our controls are under constant review with privacy impact assessments being made for data releases, new systems or changes to existing processes. This allows us to adjust control frameworks ranging from contractual arrangements to technical controls as needed.</p>\n\n<p>With the increasing threats to personal data globally we have focused on awareness and training for staff with various events across the agency such as security awareness week. We have targeted training events for our IAO’s and Information Assurance Staff. In addition all staff have to pass an annual assessment on information security principles and best practice with the pass mark set at 80%. This assessment is also used to raise  awareness of current risk and threat trends.</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward we have started preparatory work for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation coming into force during 2018. As part of this preparation we are reviewing our ISO27001 compliance against our core datasets.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"fraud-error-and-debt\">Fraud, error and debt</h4>\n\n<p>The management of fraud, error and debt is a critical part of good governance. Losses and recoveries are reported to Cabinet Office. Overall responsibility for our management of this area sits with the Director of Strategy, Policy and Communications, supported by a cross-agency Fraud, Error and Debt Board.</p>\n\n<p>Counter fraud initiatives and fraud investigations are taken forward by the Fraud Policy and Investigations Team, often in liaison with our operational Criminal Intelligence Officers. The Government Internal Audit Agency (GIAA) provides support and input to fraud investigations, advising on aspects of control and risk management.</p>\n\n<p>The Fraud Policy and Investigations team review all changes initiatives and work closely with individual business areas to fraud risk assess business processes, providing support and advice on fraud mitigation. The team is currently working with DfT to review the new government counter fraud standards which will be in place from April 2017. These are being rolled out to standardise and improve counter fraud practices across government and we will be assessing current processes in line with these standards. A new Government Counter Fraud profession will also be introduced in 2017.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"accounting-officer-assurance\">Accounting Officer assurance</h4>\n\n<p>The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level, rather than to eliminate all risk. It should provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control supports the achievement of our policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the funds and assets of the organisation, in accordance with HM Treasury’s Managing Public Money.</p>\n\n<p>As Accounting Officer for <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. This is primarily informed by our internal audit reviews, along with the management assurance reporting of our managers who are responsible for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework.</p>\n\n<p>Twice a year, a Management Assurance Statement review is undertaken to review all facets of management assurance, policy and practice. The 2016-17 Management Assurance Statement review asked our senior managers to provide performance commentary and evidence on the application of 40 aspects of assurance. There were 31 areas of substantial assurance and 9 areas of assurance were classed as moderate. Responses were compiled by subject matter experts, challenged by internal audit, ET, DfT and signed off by Audit and Risk Committee. The areas with moderate assurance (and not substantial) correspond with internal audit expectations. Action plans are in place to address any further improvements where required.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"audit-and-risk-committee-1\">Audit and Risk Committee</h4>\n\n<p>Our board and Audit and Risk Committee assist in developing and overseeing governance assurance processes and the plans to address any identified weaknesses. This ensures that continual improvement of the systems remains a priority.</p>\n\n<p>These processes apply to all our activities and transactions in the Business Account and Trust Statement. The Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee reports regularly to the board on the Audit and Risk Committee’s views on the effectiveness of our governance, risk management and internal control arrangements.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"internal-audit\">Internal audit</h4>\n\n<p>Our internal audit team are now part of the GIAA. This move increases the independence of the internal audit function and follows wider government priorities for internal audit services within the Civil Service. Benefits include greater consistency and joined up working for the provision of internal audit services across government.</p>\n\n<p>The internal audit team operates to prescribed Public Sector Internal Audit Standards and complies with procedures and standards set by the GIAA. The internal audit report provides me with an independent and objective opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of our system of internal control, together with recommendations agreed to by management for improvement to address identified areas of risk or control enhancement.</p>\n\n<p>The Head of Internal Audit has unfettered access to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and as Accounting Officer, I also work closely with the DfT Group Chief Internal Auditor within GIAA. The audit plan for the year is informed by the main risks to our business and encompasses a broad range of internal controls. This includes assurance over the security and use of our data, as well as contractual commitments and data protocols for those organisations that interact with us.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"head-of-internal-audit-opinion\">Head of Internal Audit opinion</h4>\n\n<p>On the basis of the evidence obtained during 2016-17 the Head of Internal Audit was able to provide a moderate level of assurance that the framework of governance, risk management and control is appropriately defined and working effectively throughout 2016-17.</p>\n\n<p>The Head of Internal Audit has advised that this opinion reflects the maturity of our Risk Management Framework; and our continued focus on further strengthening existing governance arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Established key controls were found to be generally working effectively but with some improvements required to enhance the adequacy and effectiveness of the framework of governance, risk management and control. The areas for further improvements and which would benefit from strengthening procedural controls are predominantly areas impacted by the significant change. There have been notable improvements in IT functions after being brought in-house as a result of the exit from the PACT contract. This reflects a change in leadership within Information Technology Services; focussing on harmonising IT services combined with organisational restructure.</p>\n\n<p>The cases where internal audit identified the need for control enhancements were not deemed significant in the context of the overall control environment. Where enhancements were proposed, corrective action has been agreed with management. Delivery against those actions is monitored closely by the Executive Team and where relevant, by the appropriate governance board (such as the DGB and Audit and Risk Committee).</p>\n\n<p>Actions agreed with management against weaknesses identified as part of the internal audit programme have contributed to the overall assurance reported within this Governance Statement.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"monitoring-of-specific-control-issues\">Monitoring of specific control issues</h4>\n\n<p>The Agency identified during the year that an element of the PACT exit costs relating to expenditure incurred on operational transition services, owing to an omission, did not have full and appropriate prospective ICT spend approval from Cabinet Office. However the Agency did receive Cabinet Office approval for the wider PACT Exit project. Cabinet Office was immediately informed and the Agency pursued this approval through the established retrospective approvals process offered under Cabinet Office guidelines; however retrospective approval was not received. Procedures have subsequently been reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>A number of ‘deep dive’ internal audit review activities during 2016-17 have identified instances where we could make further control improvements.  These have covered specific actions to address very specific control issues – predominantly (not limited to) those areas that have been the transition of IT services.  Management have agreed actions to take forward; and are closely monitored in line with the established arrangements described above.</p>\n\n<p>In the opinion of the Head of Internal Audit there are no further significant weaknesses that fall within the scope of issues that should be reported here.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"remuneration-and-staff-report\">\n<span class=\"number\">4. </span> Remuneration and staff report</h2>\n\n<h4 id=\"remuneration-report\">Remuneration report</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"remuneration-policy\">Remuneration policy</h4>\n<p>The remuneration of senior civil servants is set by the Prime Minister following independent advice from the review body on senior salaries.</p>\n\n<p>The review body takes account of the evidence it receives about wider economic considerations and the affordability of its recommendations. Further information about the work of the review body can be found at Office of Manpower Economics.</p>\n\n<p>We have our own remuneration committee in line with board best practice, chaired by a Non-Executive Director. Further details can be found within the Governance Statement.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"service-contracts\">Service contracts</h4>\n<p>Civil Service appointments are made in accordance with the Civil Service Commissioners’ Recruitment Code, it requires appointments to be based on fair and open competition but also includes the circumstances when appointments may otherwise be made. Unless otherwise stated below, the officials covered by this report hold appointments that are open-ended. Early termination, other than for misconduct, would result in the individual receiving compensation as set out in the Civil Service Compensation Scheme. The standard period of notice to be given by directors is 3 months.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"salary-and-pension-entitlements\">Salary and pension entitlements</h4>\n\n<p>The remuneration and pension interests of the Chief Executive and directors are set out below.</p>\n\n<p>The senior civil servant annual pay award bonus is determined by performance. These pay award bonuses are awarded to the top 25% of senior civil servants. They are made to reward in-year performance in relation to agreed objectives, or short-term personal contributions to wider organisational objectives.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"salary\">Salary</h4>\n\n<p>Salary includes gross salary, overtime, recruitment and retention allowances and any other allowance to the extent that it is subject to UK taxation. This report is based on payments made by us and recorded in these accounts. The directors did not receive any non-cash benefits during the current or prior year.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"performance-bonus\">Performance bonus</h4>\n<p>Performance is assessed annually for directors through the appraisal processes. These are stipulated by DfT and entitlement to performance enhancements or bonuses established in comparison across the DfT family is through the departmental evaluation committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary. Our remuneration committee provides advice to DfT on performance of directors.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"civil-service-pensions\">Civil Service pensions</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/65424/Civil_Service_Pensions_0.jpg\" alt=\"Civil Service Pensions\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>Pension benefits are provided through the Civil Service pension arrangements. From 1 April 2015 a new pension scheme for civil servants was introduced – the Civil Servants and Others Pension Scheme (CSOPS) or alpha, which provides benefits on a career average basis with a normal pension age equal to the member’s State Pension Age (or 65 if higher). From that date all newly appointed civil servants and the majority of those already in service joined alpha. Before that date, civil servants participated in the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS). The PCSPS has 4 sections: 3 providing benefits on a final salary basis (classic, premium or classic plus) with a normal pension age of 60 and one providing benefits on a whole career basis (nuvos) with a normal pension age of 65.</p>\n\n<p>These statutory arrangements are unfunded with the cost of benefits met by monies voted by Parliament each year. Pensions payable under classic, premium, classic plus, nuvos and alpha are increased annually in line with Pensions Increase legislation. Existing members of the PCSPS, who were within 10 years of their normal pension age on 1 April 2012, remained in the PCSPS after 1 April 2015. Those who were between 10 years and 13 years and 5 months from their normal pension age on 1 April 2012 will switch into alpha sometime between 1 June 2015 and 1 February 2022. All members who switch to alpha have their PCSPS benefits ‘banked’, with those with earlier benefits in one of the final salary sections of the PCSPS having those benefits based on their final salary when they leave alpha. The pension figures quoted for officials show pension earned in PCSPS or alpha – as appropriate. Where the official has benefits in both the PCSPS and alpha the figure quoted is the combined value of their benefits in the 2 schemes. Members joining from October 2002 may opt for either the appropriate defined benefit arrangement or a ‘money purchase’ stakeholder pension with an employer contribution (partnership pension account).</p>\n\n<p>Employee contributions are salary-related and range between 3.8% and 8.05% of pensionable earnings for members of classic (and members of alpha who were members of classic immediately before joining alpha) and between 4.6% and 8.05% for members of premium, classic plus, nuvos and all other members of alpha. Benefits in classic accrue at the rate of 1/80th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service. In addition, a lump sum equivalent to 3 years initial pension is payable on retirement. For premium, benefits accrue at the rate of 1/60th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service. Unlike classic, there is no automatic lump sum. Classic plus is essentially a hybrid with benefits for service before 1 October 2002 calculated broadly as per classic and benefits for service from October 2002 worked out as in premium.</p>\n\n<p>In nuvos a member builds up a pension based on their pensionable earnings during their period of scheme membership. At the end of the scheme year (31 March) the member’s earned pension account is credited with 2.3% of their pensionable earnings in that scheme year and the accrued pension is uprated in line with Pensions Increase legislation. Benefits in alpha build up in a similar way to nuvos, except that the accrual rate is 2.32%. In all cases members may opt to give up (commute) pension for a lump sum up to the limits set by the Finance Act 2004.</p>\n\n<p>The partnership pension account is a stakeholder pension arrangement. The employer makes a basic contribution of between 8% and 14.75% (depending on the age of the member) into a stakeholder pension product chosen by the employee from a panel of providers.</p>\n\n<p>The employee does not have to contribute, but where they do make contributions, the employer will match these up to a limit of 3% of pensionable salary (in addition to the employer’s basic contribution). Employers also contribute a further 0.5% of pensionable salary to cover the cost of centrally-provided risk benefit cover (death in service and ill health retirement).</p>\n\n<p>The accrued pension quoted is the pension the member is entitled to receive when they reach pension age or immediately on ceasing to be an active member of the scheme if they are already at or over pension age. Pension age is 60 for members of classic, premium and classic plus, 65 for members of nuvos and the higher of 65 or State Pension Age for members of alpha. The pension figures quoted for officials show pension earned in PCSPS or alpha – as appropriate. Where the official has benefits in both the PCSPS and alpha, the figure quoted is the combined value of their benefits in the 2 schemes, but note that part of that pension may be payable from different ages.</p>\n\n<p>For further details about the Civil Service pension arrangements visit <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.civilservicepensionscheme.org.uk/\">civilservicepensionscheme.org.uk</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cash-equivalent-transfer-values\">Cash Equivalent Transfer Values</h4>\n\n<p>A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is the actuarially assessed capitalised value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are the member’s accrued benefits and any contingent spouse’s pension payable from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme or arrangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which disclosure applies.</p>\n\n<p>The figures include the value of any pension benefit in another scheme or arrangement which the member has transferred to the Civil Service pension arrangements. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their buying additional pension benefits at their own cost. CETVs are worked out in accordance with The Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 and do not take account of any actual or potential reduction to benefits resulting from lifetime allowance tax which may be due when pension benefits are taken.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"real-increase-in-cetv\">Real increase in CETV</h4>\n\n<p>This reflects the increase in CETV that is funded by the employer. It does not include the increase in accrued pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another pension scheme or arrangement) and uses common market valuation factors for the start and end of the period.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"remuneration-of-the-executive-board-members--audited\">Remuneration of the Executive board members – audited</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"single-total-figure-of-remuneration\">Single total figure of remuneration</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Salary</th>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Performance bonus</th>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Pension benefits</th>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>Total</th>\n    <th></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th></th>\n    <th>2016-17<br>£000</th>\n    <td>2015-16<br>£000</td>\n    <th>2016-17<br>£000</th>\n    <td>2015-16<br>£000</td>\n    <th>2016-17<br>£000</th>\n    <td>2015-16<br>£000</td>\n    <th>2016-17<br>£000</th>\n    <td>2015-16<br>£000</td>\n  </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <th>Chief Executive<br>Oliver Morley¹</th>\n    <td>130-135</td>\n    <td>130-135</td>\n    <td>15-20</td>\n    <td>10-15</td>\n    <td>20-25</td>\n    <td>20-25</td>\n    <td>165-170</td>\n    <td>165-170</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Executive board members</th>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n    <td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Rachael Cunningham<br>Finance Director\n</td>\n    <td>80-85</td>\n    <td>80-85</td>\n    <td>10-15</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>35-40</td>\n    <td>120-125</td>\n    <td>115-120</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Louise White<br>HR and Estates Director (from 27 September 2016) previously Acting HR and Estates Director (from 28 June 2016)</td>\n    <td>60-65 (80-85 FYE²)</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>90-95</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>170-175</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n  </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td>Andrew Falvey<br>Commercial Director (from 12 May 2015, interim \nCommercial Director from 5 May 2014)</td>\n    <td>75-80</td>\n    <td>75-80</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>25-30</td>\n    <td>105-110</td>\n    <td>105-110</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tony Ackroyd<br>Operations and Customer Services Director</td>\n    <td>85-90</td>\n    <td>85-90</td>\n    <td>10-15</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>135-140</td>\n    <td>120-125</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Julie Lennard<br>Strategy, Policy and Communications Director</td>\n    <td>80-85</td>\n    <td>80-85</td>\n    <td>10-15</td>\n    <td>10-15</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>125-130</td>\n    <td>125-130</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Dave Perry¹<br>Chief Technology Officer (from 3 June 2016)</td>\n    <td>105-110 (125 – 130 FYE²)</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>5-10</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>110-115</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tracy Nash<br>Interim Finance Director (25 May 2016 to 30 September 2016)</td>\n    <td>20-25 (70-75 FYE²)</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>5-10</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Phil Bushby<br>HR and Estates Director (to 27 June 2016)</td>\n    <td>15-20 (70-75FYE²)</td>\n    <td>70-75</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>0-5</td>\n    <td>30-35</td>\n    <td>20-25</td>\n    <td>100-105</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Iain Patterson³ <br>Director of Technology (to 29 February 2016)</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>105-110 (115-120 FYE²)</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>5-10</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>45-50</td>\n    <td>-</td>\n    <td>160-165</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>¹ Does not participate in the PCSPS.<br>\n² Full year equivalent.<br>\n³ Iain Patterson was employed by GDS as a full-time civil servant and was seconded to <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> until 29 February 2016.

A small decrease in <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> income in this period is in line with recent forecasts from the Office for Budgetary Responsibility<sup>1</sup> (OBR). It follows similar declines in recent years, which are consistent with the tendency of average licence costs to decrease as the stock of vehicles in use becomes more fuel-efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Cash collections reported in the Trust Statement<sup>2</sup> were £6,063 million – an increase of £160 million on 2015-16. The fact that cash collected has increased while revenue has fallen reflects timing differences associated with the Direct Debit payment option having grown in popularity at a slower rate than in 2015-16.</p>\n\n<p>The OBR estimates that <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> receipts will increase progressively from 2017-18 due to the adjustment of rates for inflation and the April 2017 reforms affecting newly registered cars.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"scope-of-my-audit-work\">Scope of my audit work</h4>\n\n<p>Section 2 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921 requires me to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>examine the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> revenue accounts (reported by <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> in the Trust Statement)</li>\n  <li>ascertain whether <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> has in place adequate regulations and procedures to secure an effective check on the assessment, collection and proper allocation of revenue</li>\n  <li>evaluate whether <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> is duly carrying out any such regulations and procedure</li>\n  <li>examine the correctness of the sums brought to account; and</li>\n  <li>report the results to the House of Commons.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This report, with my audit opinions on <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s Trust Statement, together satisfy these requirements.</p>\n\n<p>My team has examined the systems supporting collection and obtained evidence on the adequacy and operations of its regulations and procedure, including consideration of <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s compliance and enforcement activities. In drawing a conclusion on <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s overall management of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>, I have considered this examination, together with my analysis of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the available data on levels of compliance in <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> payment</li>\n  <li>the <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s response to the reduced compliance levels identified last year</li>\n  <li>how the <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> uses digital services in promoting compliance; and</li>\n  <li>the challenges arising from the April 2017 reforms to <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> for newly registered cars.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-findings\">Key findings</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"levels-of-compliance-in-ved-payment\">Levels of compliance in <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> payment</h4>\n\n<p>Evidence on compliance levels for <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> primarily comes from the Roadside Survey of Vehicle Observations<sup>3</sup>, which is carried out every 2 years and estimates <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> evasion levels based on observing registration marks of vehicles in traffic carried out at 256 sites across the UK. The most recent Roadside Survey was published by the Department for Transport (DfT) in November 2015 based on data from June 2015.</p>\n\n<p>As described in my 2015-16 Report<sup>4</sup>, the Department estimated a compliance rate of 98.6%, a 0.8% decline since the previous survey in 2013.  It estimates the 1.4% of non-compliance as equivalent to  £78 million in lost revenue (though some of this may be recovered through enforcement activity).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64856/Compliance-rates.jpg\" alt=\"Compliance rates\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>This decline coincided with a significant period of change in the administration of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>: from October 2014, motorists were allowed to pay by Direct Debit; the paper tax disc was abolished; and the law was amended so that vehicle tax automatically ends when a vehicle changes ownership, rather than transferring with the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>While enforcement activity has increased during 2016-17, it is not possible with reasonable certainty to draw a link between this and compliance levels due to other variables involved. <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> is working with Department for Transport statisticians to consider what options are available for the future to identify meaningful compliance trends between surveys.</p>\n\n<p>For now, the Roadside Survey results, next due for publication in November 2017, provide the best evidence on <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s progress in restoring compliance levels to historic norms.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"responding-to-reduced-compliance-levels\">Responding to reduced compliance levels</h4>\n\n<p>In July 2016, the <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> Board approved a new Vehicle Excise Duty strategy. This commits <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> to act swiftly to ensure the increasing evasion trend is reversed and evasion returned to below 1% by 2019.  Towards this overall goal, the strategy includes aims to make <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> compliance easier; to make evasion harder; and to ensure that evaders face prompt and robust enforcement action. <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s success in implementing this strategy  will prove critical to future <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> compliance levels.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"measures-to-encourage-compliance-and-reduce-evasion\">Measures to encourage compliance and reduce evasion</h4>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> currently administers a wide range of enforcement methods to proactively encourage customers to licence their vehicles on time, as well as taking enforcement action against those who refuse to comply with their legal requirements. These range from reminder letters and the issue of penalties for continued non-compliance, through to prosecution for vehicles used on the road as well as the wheelclamping and seizure of vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>On top of existing measures, the Agency is looking to make further improvements. Some of these include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>improving its communication with customers and motor trade to minimise unintentional non-compliance</li>\n  <li>continuing to work with partners such as the Police and Local Authorities, to increase awareness of the need to keep vehicle licensing up to date</li>\n  <li>ensuring that the new Direct Debit service beds in successfully; and</li>\n  <li>further improving the ease of use of its services. For example <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> added functionality on 27 February 2017 to enable customers who pay Direct Debit to change their bank details via the contact centre, in cases where they are unable to do so via a switching service. Between service launch and 11 April 2017 <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> had over 4,000 requests to use this service.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"ensuring-prompt-enforcement\">Ensuring prompt enforcement</h4>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s primary focus in the administration of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> is to promote compliance.  Nevertheless, enforcement action remains important both as a means of recovering money owed and as a deterrent against non-compliance. Current enforcement mechanisms include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to detect unlicensed vehicles on the road which results in a fine</li>\n  <li>the issue of penalties for continued non-compliance</li>\n  <li>wheelclamping</li>\n  <li>prosecutions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since 2013-14, there has been an overall increase in <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> enforcement action across the <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s business, including a 168% increase in Out of Court Settlements; a 155% increase in the number of penalties issued; a 159% increase in prosecutions; and a 166% increase in wheelclamping operations. The majority of these increases occurred during the 2015-17 period, following the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> rule changes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64860/Percentage-increase-in-VED.jpg\" alt=\"Percentage increase in VED\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>Source: Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</p>\n\n<p>A significant proportion of the increase in penalties issued relates to Direct Debit penalties, following the introduction of that payment option in October 2014. Direct Debit penalties are issued at the end of a fully automated enforcement process which allows customers the opportunity to either pay the full outstanding balance of their licence or re-tax. Failure to do either will result in a penalty being issued which if not paid is referred to external debt collectors.</p>\n\n<p>Out of Court Settlements following ANPR detections of unlicensed vehicles have also been rising in recent years. From October 2016, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> has increased the use of its mobile fleet, which provides wider coverage and additional unpredictability.  The accuracy of information on whether detected cars are licensed has also been increased as the relevant data are now updated more regularly. As ANPR detections data accumulates, it may be possible to gain insight on general evasion trends from this data series and use that to inform evaluation of performance against <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> compliance targets.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"supporting-enforcement-efforts\">Supporting enforcement efforts</h4>\n\n<p>To assess the accuracy of its records, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> undertakes an annual Traceability Survey to estimate how accurate its records are. In 2015-16 Traceability Survey estimates that the accuracy of <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s records at 92.6% (2014-15: 95.2%), against <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s target of 95%. <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> recognises the need to make progress in this area.</p>\n\n<p>In respect of court space, HM Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS) are undergoing reforms which would, in theory, allow more flexibility in where offences can be prosecuted. We encourage <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> to continue to work with HMCTS and to ensure that it is prepared to realise the benefits of any increased court capacity which becomes available.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"dvlas-digital-services-and-their-impact-on-ved-collection\">\n<abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s digital services and their impact on <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> collection</h4>\n\n<p>Increasingly, service users choose to transact with <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> online. <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s development of its digital services will affect the experience of these service users, but will also play a key role in its efforts to improve <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> compliance levels.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"take-up-levels-for-online-ved-payment\">Take-up levels for online <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> payment</h4>\n\n<p>The option to license a vehicle online has been available since 2004, alongside the option to pay at the Post Office, or by telephone. Direct Debit options have been available either online or at the Post Office since October 2014.</p>\n\n<p>As <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s online services have developed, take-up has increased significantly. Between April 2013 and March 2017, the proportion of vehicle tax paid through fully digital methods increased from 55.0% to 80.3%.  There are corresponding reductions in the level of transactions through the Post Office (43.7% down to 19.3%) and a reduction in manual applications (i.e. at a <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> office or by telephone) from 1.3% down to 0.4%.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"vehicle-licencing-by-channel-over-time\">Vehicle licencing by channel over time</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\"><div class=\"img\"><img src=\"https://assets-origin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/64857/Vehicle-licensing-by-channel.jpg\" alt=\"Vehicle licensing by channel\"></div></figure>\n\n<p>Source: Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"online-payment-option-for-penalties\">Online payment option for penalties</h4>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> continues to develop its digital services in response to both user expectation and business need.

As planned, revisions to the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> system were running as of 1 April 2017, and <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> has communicated the changes through multiple channels. <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> will need to ensure that the effects of the changes, which introduce additional complexity in calculating <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> rates, are properly monitored, both in terms of assuring the proper operation of the new system in practice and in evaluating the effect of these changes on compliance levels.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-revised-ved-rules-for-new-car-registrations\">The revised <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> rules for new car registrations</h4>\n\n<p>Under the new regime the amount of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> payable in the first year for new cars  varies heavily based on CO2 emissions, following which the tax reverts to a set rate, for the car’s fuel type. Cars with a list price of more than £40,000 also pay an additional rate for 5 years from the second time they are taxed. The changes are set out in full on the GOV.UK <sup>6</sup> and summarised in the following table (amounts assume single payments for a 12 month period).</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th>Petrol or Diesel</th>\n<th>Alternative Fuel<sup>7</sup>\n</th>\n<th>Electric</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> due in year 1</td>\n<td>£0 - £2,000 depending on CO2 emissions</td>\n<td>£0 - £1,990 depending on CO2 emissions</td>\n<td>Nil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">\n<abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> due in years 2 to 6</td>\n<td>List price below £40,000</td>\n<td>£140</td>\n<td>£130</td>\n<td>Nil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>List price above £40,000</td>\n<td>£450 (including £310 additional rate)</td>\n<td>£440 (including £310 additional rate)</td>\n<td>£310</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> due in year 7 onwards</td>\n<td>£140</td>\n<td>£130</td>\n<td>Nil</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>In preparation for these reforms, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> has focused its efforts in 2 areas: working with stakeholders and investing in IT systems to ensure they are ready to accurately process the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> rates and rules.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"working-with-stakeholders\">Working with stakeholders</h4>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> put significant effort into communicating the upcoming changes. In July 2016, the test version of the new V55 Vehicle Registration pack was issued to dealers and manufacturers, with amendments to First Registration forms and leaflets finalised in October 2016. From November 2016, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> began to implement its stakeholder communication strategy, which included a social media campaign, changes to the GOV.UK website and campaigns targeted at car dealers and the second-hand market.</p>\n\n<p>The reforms introduce additional complexity which involves obtaining additional data from stakeholders.  Specifically, determining the list price as an input to the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> calculation involves adding to the retail price certain items, such as the price of non-standard option fitted by the manufacturer, delivery charges and the cost price of any leased battery for electric cars. As a result, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> has needed to develop closer working relationships with car manufacturers to ensure the list price for all new cars is accurately captured in the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> database. As before, car dealers are responsible for the collection of the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> payable in year 1 (which in many cases will now be at an enhanced level) and for passing it to <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s performance in the administration and collection of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> following the current round of reforms will continue to rely on the efficiency of these industry partnerships.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"it-development\">IT development</h4>\n\n<p>In response to the 2017 <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> reforms, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>  implemented a new cloud-based <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> calculation service designed to handle the new rules, together with new interfaces with the updated vehicles database and dealers, to ensure that the correct tax is charged.  This has involved a significant degree of change and required integration of new code with existing systems.</p>\n\n<p>The revised system was running from 1 April 2017 and management are monitoring its availability.  During the first month of operation, reported system downtime was minimal.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> is also planning internal assurance work in the coming year to check that the updated system properly reflects new statutory requirements; this will also provide a focus for my work in 2017-18 both on the Trust Statement and in support of my Section 2 Report.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>Based on their examination, my team found that the systems in place for the administration and collection of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>, managed by <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> through a range of channels, are reasonable in their design and were operated effectively throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p>It is too early to say whether <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> has begun to reverse the trend in <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> compliance seen in the 2015 Roadside Survey. While the 2015 figures for non-compliance, at 1.4%, are far below the tax gap estimate for other revenue streams, it is right that <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> make returning to previous levels a high priority. The 2017 Survey will provide valuable data on which to base <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s next steps. As the survey is to be performed only once every 2 years it would be sensible to consider whether data – for example from the ANPR camera fleet – could be used to provide indications of evasion trends, so that <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> can evaluate the effectiveness of enforcement measures on a more timely basis.</p>\n\n<p>Future performance will depend to some extent on <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>’s success in managing through a period of transformation. The agency is rightly looking to adapt systems and work with stakeholders to address issues emerging from the 2014 reforms. At the same time, it maintains a high pace of organisational change geared towards transacting more business online and bringing IT expertise in house and has just completed the implementation of a more complex <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> regime for new car registrations.</p>\n\n<p>As well as keeping its focus on user experience and service availability, <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> should ensure that – in line with the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> Strategy agreed this year – it gives sufficient priority to the available mitigations to exchequer losses.  This will mean:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>quickly gathering and applying intelligence on the causes of both evasion and unintentional non-compliance, including any newly arising from the April 2017 reforms</li>\n  <li>ensuring the nature and level of enforcement activity is fit for purpose both in maximising the recovery of funds owed and in providing a deterrent</li>\n  <li>allocating sufficient priority and resource to resolving known issues affecting collection,</li>\n  <li>working effectively with partners in both industry and government and</li>\n  <li>actively monitoring progress towards the 99% compliance target, including through the use of data available between Roadside Surveys (for example, ANPR detections) which could provide indications of evasion trends.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h4>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Office for Budget Responsibility, Economic and Fiscal Outlook March 2016, available at: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/March2016EFO.pdf\">http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/March2016EFO.pdf</a>.<br>\n<sup>2</sup>In addition to <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>, the Trust Statement includes the much smaller HGV Road User Levy revenue stream, collected by the <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> on behalf of the Consolidated Fund.

The amount of the revaluation reserve that relates to intangible assets at 31 March 2017 is £16.9 million (31 March 2016: £16.8 million).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"notes-to-the-accounts\">Notes to the accounts</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-1-statement-of-accounting-policies\">Note 1. Statement of accounting policies</h4>\n\n<p>The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 2016-17 Government Financial Reporting Manual (FReM) issued by HM Treasury. The accounting policies contained in the FReM apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adapted or interpreted for the public sector context.</p>\n\n<p>Where the FReM permits a choice, the accounting policy which has been judged to be the most appropriate to the particular circumstances of our Business Account for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted by the agency are described below. They have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material to the accounts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"adoption-of-new-and-revised-standards\">Adoption of new and revised standards</h4>\n\n<p>No new accounting standards became effective for the first time in 2016-17.</p>\n\n<p>A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2017 and have not been applied in these financial statements.  The following new standards may affect the accounts if they are adopted by the Financial Reporting Manual, after further consultation:</p>\n\n<p>IFRS 9 addresses classification, measurement and impairment of financial instruments and is still subject to analysis and consideration by HM Treasury with a view to include in the 2018-19 FReM.  It is thought that IFRS 9 will result in terminology changes, however there should be no changes to how <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> measures its financial assets and liabilities.</p>\n\n<p>IFRS 15 covers the recognition of revenues from contracts with customers. HM Treasury released an exposure draft for inclusion in the 2018-19 FReM.  It is not thought that this will materially affect the timing of recognition or amounts recognised.</p>\n\n<p>IFRS 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value. The probable impact is that there will be earlier recognition of expenditure in relation to leases (amortisation and interest).  It is not yet clear when or with what degree of adaptation this standard will be reflected in the FReM.  The IFRS will become effective in the private sector for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019.</p>\n\n<p>IFRS9 and IFRS 15 have been endorsed by the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> to date.  The full impact will not be known until the FReM adopts or adapts these standards.</p>\n\n<p>We do not consider that any other new or revised standard or interpretation will have a material impact.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"accounting-convention\">Accounting convention</h4>\n\n<p>These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and inventories and certain financial assets and liabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the revised accounts direction issued by HM Treasury on 19 December 2016. They meet the relevant requirements of the FReM adapted IFRS. We are not aware of any disclosures or circumstances where these are inappropriate. The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.</p>\n\n<p>The Business Account does not include any amounts collected by the <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> where it was acting as an agent of the Consolidated Fund rather than as principal. Full details of income collected as Agent for the Consolidated Fund are in the Trust Statement published separately from but alongside these financial statements.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"income\">Income</h4>\n\n<p>Income from the sale of registration marks is recognised on receipt of payment for fixed price sales and on the fall of the auctioneer’s hammer for sales at auction. Uncompleted sales are provided for after 90 days and are written out of sales after twelve months, with the related marks becoming available for resale. Fee income from the assignment, transfer and retention of cherished registration marks is recognised on receipt, when the transaction is processed, as is that from fee-bearing statutory services. All other income is recognised when the services and goods are issued.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"finance-income-and-finance-costs\">Finance income and finance costs</h4>\n\n<p>As an Executive Agency, we do not earn interest on funds invested.</p>\n\n<p>Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and unwinding of the discount on provisions. Borrowing costs are recognised in net operating cost or income using the effective interest method.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"taxation\">Taxation</h4>\n\n<p>We are not liable to pay Corporation Tax. Expenditure is shown net of recoverable VAT. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or, if appropriate, capitalised with additions to non-current assets. Income and expenditure is otherwise shown net of VAT.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cash-and-cash-equivalents\">Cash and cash equivalents</h4>\n\n<p>Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances in non-interest bearing accounts. We do not have any bank overdrafts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"non-current-assets-property-plant-and-equipment\">Non-current assets: property, plant and equipment</h4>\n\n<p>We revalue our non-current asset portfolio on 31 March each financial year in accordance with the requirements of the FReM. A full valuation of our estate is carried out every 5 years. The last full valuation was undertaken on 31 March 2014 by Joseph M L Funtek BSc (Hons) MRICS of Gerald Eve LLP.</p>\n\n<p>The existing use valuation basis was applied to the majority of assets save for those which are considered to be specialised in which case those assets were valued on a depreciated replacement cost basis.</p>\n\n<p>A desktop valuation exercise was carried out for land and buildings in the interim period at 31 March 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Plant and machinery, fixtures and fittings, computer equipment, motor vehicles and office equipment are revalued in accordance with price indices published by the Office of National Statistics (MM22 Producer Price Indices). Surpluses and deficits arising on revaluation are charged to the Revaluation Reserve. Where it is not possible for any such deficit to be offset by previous surpluses in the Revaluation Reserve, it is charged to revenue as are permanent diminutions in the value of fixed assets. Ownership of our assets is vested in the Secretary of State for Transport. The minimum level for capitalisation is £5,000.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"non-current-assets-intangible-assets\">Non-current assets: intangible assets</h4>\n\n<p>The value of licences to operate the driver and vehicle systems is capitalised. Software development costs are capitalised, excluding any costs incurred in the planning and design stages of the project, which are clearly defined and separate from the build phase of a project. New expenditure on IT systems development is written off in the period in which it is incurred, unless a beneficial relationship to a future period can be established with reasonable certainty, in which case the charge is capitalised. We review our projects and operational software for impairment and revalue our intangible assets annually based on Depreciated Replacement Cost.</p>\n\n<p>The value of the driver and vehicle databases cannot be estimated. Our personalised registrations database, including unallocated vehicle registration marks, is a very large store of possible combinations of alpha-numeric characters and is affected by changes in opinion, taste and judgement. As a result, the potential future sales value is not recognised in our statement of financial position, as it cannot be reliably estimated.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"depreciation-and-amortisation\">Depreciation and amortisation</h4>\n\n<p>Depreciation is provided on intangible and tangible non-current assets from the date they are commissioned into operational service, except for computer equipment, which is provided for at the date of purchase. When assets are revalued the depreciation continues on the revised value over the remaining useful life of the relevant asset. The estimated useful lives from new of the main categories of non-current assets are:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> </th>\n      <th>Years</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Plant and machinery</td>\n      <td>3 - 10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>IT equipment</td>\n      <td>3 - 5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Purchased software</td>\n      <td>up to 10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Office equipment</td>\n      <td>5 - 10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Software licences/development</td>\n      <td>3 - 15</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Fixtures and fittings</td>\n      <td>5 - 10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Motor vehicles</td>\n      <td>5 - 10</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The estimated remaining useful lives of buildings on 31 March 2017 are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>32 years , Morriston site (excluding J and E blocks)</li>\n  <li>17 years, J and E blocks (Morriston site)</li>\n  <li>27 years, Richard Ley Development Centre at Swansea Vale.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The estimated useful lives of assets are reviewed regularly and when necessary, revised. Land (freehold and leasehold) is not depreciated.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"leases\">Leases</h4>\n\n<p>Operating lease rentals are charged to the statement of comprehensive net expenditure on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</p>\n\n<p>Leases in which the agency assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"provisions\">Provisions</h4>\n\n<p>The agency makes provision for liabilities and charges in accordance with IAS 37 where, at the end of the current reporting period, a legal or constructive liability (for example a present obligation from past events) exists, the transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using the rates set by HM Treasury. When the discount is unwound, the adjustment is recognised as an interest expense. Further details are provided in respect of our most significant provisions below.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"modernisation-of-network-services-provision\">Modernisation of network services provision</h4>\n\n<p>In 2012-13 we implemented plans for the phased closure of 39 local offices and 10 enforcement area offices to centralise operations in Swansea by December 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Future payments to be made under the provision for the modernisation of network services are discounted at the HM Treasury advised rates for General Provisions.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"early-departure-costs-provision\">Early departure costs provision</h4>\n\n<p>We provide for future annual compensation payments to certain former employees who have taken early retirement. Compensation is payable from the date of retirement until age 60.</p>\n\n<p>We are responsible for 20% of the liability to former employees that took early retirement between 1 October 1994 and 31 March 1996 and met certain criteria. This liability is provided for within the early departure provision. The remaining liability is met centrally by the Civil Superannuation Vote.</p>\n\n<p>For departures between April 1996 and March 1997, HM Treasury introduced capping arrangements that limit the central contribution for these departures to a maximum of £99,000 per annum.</p>\n\n<p>We announced a Voluntary Early Retirement (VER) scheme in 2005-06 and a Flexible Early Retirement (FER) scheme in 2009-10. We are responsible in full for the liability to former employees who take early retirement under the VER and FER schemes and provides for the liability within the Early Departure Costs provision.</p>\n\n<p>Future payments to be made under the Early Departure and Voluntary Retirement schemes are discounted at the HM Treasury advised rate of 0.24% (2015-16: 1.37%).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tax-officers-pensions-and-compensation-payments-provision\">Tax officers’ pensions and compensation payments provision</h4>\n\n<p>We make payments in relation to costs of former taxation officers employed by local authorities before the creation of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre in 1972. Certain individuals remained within the Local Government Pension Scheme. We contribute to the local authorities concerned towards the annual cost of these pensions. We also make compensation payments to a number of individuals in respect of loss of emoluments when the Local Taxation Offices closed. A provision has been made for future costs. An actuarial valuation is carried out every 3 years to determine future liabilities, with the latest valuation carried out on the 31 March 2016.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"pensions\">Pensions</h4>\n\n<p>Present and past employees are covered by the provisions of PCSPS and the CSOPS known as ‘alpha’, which is described in the Remuneration Report. We recognise the expected cost of providing pensions on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which it benefits from employees’ services by payment to the PCSPS of amounts calculated on an accruing basis. Liability for payment of future benefits is a charge on the PCSPS and alpha. In respect of the defined contribution schemes, we recognise the contributions payable for the year.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"research-and-development\">Research and development</h4>\n\n<p>We consider our expenditure each year to determine if any is considered to be research and development.</p>\n\n<p>In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets, expenditure incurred on pure and applied research is treated as an operating charge in the year in which it is incurred. Development expenditure is for the development of specific business systems. Expenditure which does not meet the criteria for capitalisation is treated as an operating cost in the year in which it is incurred. Development costs meeting the criteria for capitalisation are treated as intangible fixed assets and amortised as explained in the intangible non-current asset note (note 6). Non-current assets acquired for use in development are depreciated over the expected useful life of the underlying system.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"private-finance-initiative-pfi-contract-for-estates\">Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract for estates</h4>\n\n<p>On the 4 April 2005, we entered into a 20-year service concession agreement with Telereal Trillium (formerly Land Securities Trillium). This agreement falls within the scope of IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements and has been set up to provide the following property outsourcing solutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>building maintenance</li>\n  <li>office moves</li>\n  <li>cleaning</li>\n  <li>catering and vending</li>\n  <li>furniture repair</li>\n  <li>furniture replacement</li>\n  <li>grounds maintenance</li>\n  <li>waste management and pest control.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are invoiced on a monthly basis and this revenue expenditure is recorded as a service charge in the Statement of comprehensive net expenditure.</p>\n\n<p>At the start of the contract, Telereal Trillium undertook a refurbishment of the Morriston site. Where the work is capital in nature (air conditioning, double-glazing, lifts and specialist cabling), the costs were capitalised on Independent Assessors’ sign off for each floor as complete and ready for use. The air conditioning, double-glazing and lifts are depreciated over the length of the PFI contract. The cabling is depreciated over its expected useful life of 10 years. A PFI liability was created to reflect the liabilities relating to property, plant and equipment paid for under the PFI unitary charge. This creditor is reduced over the life of the contract as payments are made. In accordance with HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual requirements, the interest part of the unitary charge relating to the assets capitalised has been calculated using the actuarial method.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"financial-instruments\">Financial instruments</h4>\n\n<p>Financial instruments are contractual arrangements that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets are typically cash or rights to receive cash or equity instruments in another entity. Financial liabilities are typically obligations to transfer cash. A contractual right to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with other entities will also be a financial asset or liability, depending on whether the conditions are potentially favourable or adverse to the reporting entity.</p>\n\n<p>Non-derivative financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash equivalents. These are classified as loans and receivables. We initially recognise these assets on the date that they are originated, and derecognises them when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire.</p>\n\n<p>Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value on the date that they originated. Fair value is usually at the original invoiced amount. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.</p>\n\n<p>Non-derivative financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, obligations under finance leases and obligations under on-balance sheet PFI contracts. We recognise these liabilities initially on the trade date at which we become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and derecognise when our contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired. Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Fair value is usually at the original invoiced amount. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"impairment-of-financial-assets\">Impairment of financial assets</h4>\n\n<p>We assess at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired. This could be as a result of one or more loss events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and before the balance sheet date, and the loss event or events has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the portfolio that can be reliably estimated.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.</p>\n\n<p>We do not hold any derivative financial instruments.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"contingent-liabilities\">Contingent liabilities</h4>\n\n<p>In accordance with IAS 37, we disclose as contingent liabilities potential future obligations arising from past obligating events, where the existence of such obligations remains uncertain pending the outcome of future events outside of our control, unless their likelihood is considered to be remote. Guarantees, indemnities and undertakings are treated as contingent liabilities.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to contingent liabilities disclosed in accordance with IAS 37, we disclose for Parliamentary reporting and accountability purposes certain statutory and non-statutory contingent liabilities where the likelihood of a transfer of economic benefit is remote, but which have been reported to Parliament in accordance with the requirements of Managing Public Money.</p>\n\n<p>Where the time value of money is material, contingent liabilities which are required to be disclosed under IAS 37 are stated at discounted amounts and the amount reported to Parliament separately noted.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"contingent-assets\">Contingent assets</h4>\n\n<p>In accordance with IAS 37, we disclose contingent assets that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the agency and where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"use-of-estimates-and-judgements\">Use of estimates and judgements</h4>\n\n<p>The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>\n\n<p>Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.</p>\n\n<p>Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are set out below.</p>\n\n<p>Provisions for liabilities and charges – the main estimates relate to the discount rate which is provided by HM Treasury and estimates of future spend in the Modernising Network Services provision, in particular regarding the elements relating to onerous leases.</p>\n\n<p>The critical assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year relate to the estimated useful economic life of intangible assets. These are based on management’s judgement of assets of a similar nature and historical trends and are revised where appropriate. Where material, the cost of untaken staff leave has been estimated and accrued.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"consolidated-fund-extra-receipts\">Consolidated fund extra receipts</h4>\n\n<p>Payments due to the Consolidated Fund from the Business Account represent amounts in excess of costs for our personalised registration/cherished transfer transactions. The income from these transactions is only deemed as due to the Consolidated Fund after the recovery of these costs. The surplus Consolidated Fund Extra Receipts are recognised in the statement of taxpayers’ equity in compliance with the 2016-17 FReM.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"supply-funding\">Supply funding</h4>\n\n<p>Supply funding is provided by DfT and is recognised as financing within the statement of changes in taxpayers’ equity.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"note-2-statement-of-income-cost-by-operating-segment\">Note 2.

Statement of accounting policies</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"basis-of-accounting\">Basis of accounting</h4>\n\n<p>We prepare a Trust Statement (‘the Statement’) for the financial year ended 31 March 2017 for the revenue and other income, as directed by HM Treasury, collected by the agency as an agent for others. It is done in compliance with the accounting principles and disclosure requirements of the edition of the Government Financial Reporting Manual by HM Treasury (‘FReM’) which is in force for 2016-17.</p>\n\n<p>The Trust Statement is prepared in accordance with the accounts direction issued by HM Treasury under Section 2 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921. The Trust Statement is prepared in accordance with the accounting policies detailed below. These have been agreed between <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr>, DfT and HM Treasury and have been developed with reference to International Financial Reporting Standards and other relevant guidance.</p>\n\n<p>The accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts.</p>\n\n<p>The revenue and associated expenditure contained in these statements are those flows of funds which we handle on behalf of the Consolidated Fund and where it is acting as agent rather than as principal. Although showing net liabilities because of the differences between the recognition of revenue and the payment of cash these accounts are prepared on a going concern basis.</p>\n\n<p>The financial information contained in the statements and in the notes is rounded to the nearest £million.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"accounting-convention-1\">Accounting convention</h4>\n\n<p>These accounts have been prepared on an accruals basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"general-accounting-policies\">General accounting policies</h4>\n\n<h4 id=\"revenue\">Revenue</h4>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>, fines and penalties and HGV Levy are measured in accordance with IAS 18. They are measured at the fair value of amounts received or receivable net of repayments. Revenue is recognised when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a taxable event has occurred, the revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits from the taxable event will flow to the Exchequer. A taxable event occurs in the case of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> and UK HGV Levy when it is collected from a taxpayer (non UK levy at point of purchase), as under FReM 8.2.3, we do not recognise income in relation to evasion. Licence fees are deemed to accrue evenly over the period for which the licence is valid. Repayments are accounted for on a cash basis and recognised in the year in which payment is made</li>\n  <li>a penalty is validly imposed and an obligation to pay arises</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Late Licensing Penalty (LLP) letters are issued to vehicle keepers who fail to relicense or declare Statutory off Road Notification (SORN) within 2 months of licence expiry. Fine payments are made through our contact centre. We also employ debt collectors to recover fines not recovered directly.</p>\n\n<p>Debt collection agents are issued cases monthly from us to pursue further. Revenue is either recovered by agents and paid over to <abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr> gross or paid directly to us from customers. Commission earned by agents is invoiced to us separately. We pay LLP income net of commission to HM Treasury as Consolidated Fund Extra Receipts under a specific arrangement.</p>\n\n<p>Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE) was introduced in 2011-12 when it became an offence to be the registered keeper of an uninsured vehicle. A registered vehicle must be insured at all times unless it is being kept off road and a SORN made.</p>\n\n<p>Fixed penalty notices are issued to registered keepers who fail either to insure or are not CIE exempt through vehicle status or tax class. The £100 penalty notice is reduced to £50 if paid within 21 days.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"other-income\">Other income</h4>\n\n<p>The HGV Road User Levy applies to HGVs weighing 12 tonnes or more and is aimed at ensuring these vehicles make a contribution to the wear and tear of the UK road network. UK hauliers make levy payments in accordance with pre-existing arrangements for <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>. Non-UK hauliers make levy payments through a third party, Northgate Public Services. The role of Northgate is to administer this charge and to make pay-overs to HM Treasury, which are accounted for within the Trust Statement.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"business-account-3\">Business Account</h4>\n\n<p>The following transactions are accounted for in the Business Account set out earlier in this document and are covered by its related accounting policies:</p>\n\n<p>a) Fixed assets<br>\nb) Losses <br>\nc) Cost of collection and enforcement of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"use-of-estimates-and-judgements-1\">Use of estimates and judgements</h4>\n\n<p>The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.</p>\n\n<p>Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.</p>\n\n<p>Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in note 7.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"bad-and-doubtful-debts\">Bad and doubtful debts</h4>\n\n<p>To give a true and fair view, it is necessary to make allowance for those <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> and enforcement receivables that we believe will be unlikely to be received in the future.</p>\n\n<p>A provision has been estimated using analysis of historic trends in debt recovery and write-offs and is supported by management judgement.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"evasion\">Evasion</h4>\n\n<p>The costs of <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> evasion are outside the scope of the Trust Statement.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"related-party-disclosure\">Related party disclosure</h4>\n\n<p>We are part of DfT.
