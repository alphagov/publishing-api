We are also consulting on a change to our previous decisions for English language, English literature and mathematics, about how grades 8 and 9 are set.</p>\n\n<p>Our proposals are designed to protect students taking the new qualifications, particularly in the first year when teachers will be less familiar with the new content and how it is assessed. We want to minimise unexpected or unfair outcomes for students in the transition to the new GCSEs.</p>\n</div>",
