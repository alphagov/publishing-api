You must either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have had a Tier 4  educational oversight inspection or a statutory education inspection, and you must have achieved the required rating</li>\n  <li>be recognised as an overseas HEI offering short-term ‘study abroad’ programmes in your own premises in the UK</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can find out more information in the ‘Educational Oversight requirement’ section in document 1 of the Tier 4  <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsor-a-tier-4-student-guidance-for-educators\">sponsor guidance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a Tier 4 sponsor, you must comply with the guidance for sponsors and fulfil certain duties.

It will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>give you a suitable allocation of <abbr title=\"Confirmation for acceptance for studies\">CAS</abbr>, dependent on the size of your current student body</li>\n  <li>make visits, pre-arranged or not, to check compliance</li>\n  <li>issue civil penalties if it finds evidence that you have breached the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/employersandsponsors/preventingillegalworking/currentguidanceandcodes/full-guide?view=Binary\">illegal working regulations</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Where there has been a breach of sponsor duties, <abbr title=\"UK Visas and Immigration\">UKVI</abbr> will consider the nature of the breach and may take compliance action against you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tier-4-sponsor-status\">Tier 4 sponsor status</h2>\n\n<p>When you have had a probationary sponsor licence for 12 months, you must apply for a basic compliance assessment in order to gain Tier 4 Sponsor status. <abbr title=\"UK Visas and Immigration\">UKVI</abbr> will revoke your licence if you do not meet the requirements.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsor-a-tier-4-student-guidance-for-educators\">sponsor guidance</a>  explains how to apply for a basic compliance assessment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tier-4-premium-customer-service\">Tier 4 premium customer service</h2>\n\n<p>The Tier 4 premium customer service is designed to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>offer your organisation support in sponsoring all overseas students</li>\n  <li>develop a relationship with you and a long-term understanding of your requirements</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tier-4-premium-customer-service-for-sponsors\">Tier 4 premium customer service for sponsors</a> contains more information on this service.</p>\n\n</div>",
