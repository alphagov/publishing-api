With over 30,000 substances on the EU market above 1 tonne per year, <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> was needed to address the issues including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>delays in assessing substances in previous regulations</li>\n  <li>increasing public concern and</li>\n  <li>very limited information available on hazards and risks to human health and the environment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The main objective of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> is a high level of protection of human health and the environment, while maintaining the competitiveness and innovation of the EU chemicals industry. <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> provides a single regulatory framework for the control of chemicals, replacing the previous patchwork of controls, and ensures information on the properties of chemicals is transmitted down the supply chain, and enabling them to be safely handled.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"next-steps-for-businesses\">Next steps for businesses</h2>\n\n<p>Now that the first phase-in registration deadline of 30 November 2010 has passed, businesses need to be careful not to relax too much, as there remains a lot to do regarding ongoing <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> implementation. </p>\n\n<p>Top of that list is the need to ensure that if you have been notified by the European Chemicals Agency (<abbr title=\"European Chemicals Agency\">ECHA</abbr>) that more information is needed for your registration, you must provide that by the deadline <abbr title=\"European Chemicals Agency\">ECHA</abbr> gives you for that, otherwise you may have to stop manufacturing or importing until you have submitted a successful registration.</p>\n\n<p>For business that have successfully registered, the focus now needs to be on communicating updates to the Safety Data Sheets (<abbr title=\"Safety Data Sheets\">SDSs</abbr>) in your supply chains, particularly including the new extended <abbr title=\"Safety Data Sheet\">SDS</abbr> with exposure scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>For businesses that have to register by 1 June 2013, don’t be fooled into thinking that you have plenty of time. </p>\n\n<p>Experience the first time around shows that preparations take much more time than initially thought, and the main thing to be concentrating on now is developing good supply chain communications between suppliers and downstream users to ensure all relevant information for registration is gathered.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure that your Substance Information Exchange Forum (<abbr title=\"Substance Information Exchange Forum\">SIEF</abbr>) is working, and there is a Lead Registrant in charge - if there isn’t consider doing that role yourself in order to get things moving quickly; it may cost you a bit more, but you certainly cannot afford to do nothing.  Your costs will pay back over the next couple of years.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> and the UK Enforcement Regime for <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> including frequently asked questions, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/\">UK <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also contact the <abbr title=\"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\">Defra</abbr> <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> team by email at <a href=\"mailto:reachteam@defra.gsi.gov.uk\">reachteam@defra.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20082852_en_1\">The <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Enforcement Regulations 2008 (SI 2008 No.2852)</a> provide for the enforcement of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> by</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>allocating responsibility for <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> to a number of enforcing authorities</li>\n  <li>providing these enforcing authorities with the powers they need; requiring enforcing authorities to cooperate and share information with other bodies connected to <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> enforcement and</li>\n  <li>setting the offences and penalties for contraventions of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"animal-testing\">Animal testing</h2>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> makes it mandatory to share all existing animal test data within SIEFs, to avoid the need for duplicate tests. <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> has strong provisions to minimise the use of animal testing and the numbers of animals used in tests. The UK played a leading role in getting these provisions into the <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> legal text.</p>\n\n<p>When putting together proposals for additional testing of substances to gather missing information for substance registrations, businesses must comply with the <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> requirements on the use of animal testing.</p>\n\n<p>You can find more information on these requirements on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/18animaltesting.pdf\">UK <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"authorisation\">Authorisation</h2>\n\n<p>The first set of six substances of very high concern (<abbr title=\"substances of very high concern\">SVHC</abbr>) have now been placed on <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Annex XIV, which means that in three to four years’ time they will be banned unless authorisations to continue specific uses have been granted by the European Commission. To find out what these substances are, and more information on the <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> authorisation process, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/resources/19authorisation.pdf\">UK <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"evaluation\">Evaluation</h2>\n\n<p>Now that the first registration deadline has passed, the evaluation element of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> starts to work. There are two parts to this - dossier evaluation, where testing proposals are assessed and registration dossiers are checked for compliance, and substance evaluation, where substances considered to be of concern may be further examined by Member State Competent Authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Dossier evaluation is starting now, while substance evaluation will begin in earnest in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>More information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://echa.europa.eu/reach/evaluation_en.asp\">evaluation is available from the <abbr title=\"European Chemicals Agency\">ECHA</abbr> website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"restriction\">Restriction</h2>\n\n<p>Restriction is the alternative method in <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> of controlling hazardous substances that do not fully meet the criteria for authorisation. It imposes harmonised controls on the uses of such substances across the EU, up to and including a complete ban as appropriate. Current restrictions are listed in <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Annex XVII.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-uk-reach-competent-authority-steering-committee\">The UK <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority Steering Committee</h3>\n\n<p>The Competent Authority is overseen by a Steering Committee which comprises representatives of the four responsible authorities for <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> in the UK (ie the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, Scottish government ministers, Welsh Assembly government ministers, and Northern Ireland ministers), and other government departments with a significant interest in the implementation of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>The Committee agrees the policies that the UK representatives put forward at EU-level <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> meetings, and also advises, supports, and holds to account the UK <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority as it delivers its tasks.  </p>\n\n<p>Read the <span id=\"attachment_891446\" class=\"attachment-inline\">\n  <a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/399112/steering-committee-tor-1007.pdf\">Competent Authority Steering Committee's terms of reference</a>\n  (<span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">565KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">2 pages</span>)\n</span>\n and latest minutes -

These documents cover detailed guidance for a range of essential <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> process as well as for some specific scientific and/or technical methods that industry or authorities need to make use of under <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>These documents have been developed with the participation of many stakeholders: Industry, Member States and NGOs. The objective of these documents is to facilitate the implementation of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> by describing good practice on how to fulfil their obligations. Further information can be found at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/guidance_en.htm\"><abbr title=\"European Chemicals Agency\">ECHA</abbr> website</a> and at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/guidance.htm\">UK <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> Competent Authority’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"evaluation-of-the-eu-reach-regulation\">Evaluation of the EU <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> regulation</h3>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> requires each EU Member State to report to the European Commission every five years, starting from 1 June 2010, on the operation of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> in their respective territories. Within the UK, queries on <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> operation and impacts may also come from a number of sources, such as Parliament, governments, industry, and non-governmental stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>A study commissioned by <abbr title=\"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\">Defra</abbr> drew up a detailed list of possible indicators, likely costs, what the confounding factors may be in measuring them successfully, and thus their feasibility and suitability for reporting on <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> impacts.  <abbr title=\"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\">Defra</abbr> is now considering how best to use this information in developing a system for monitoring and evaluating the operation and impact of <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> in the UK.  A copy of the scoping study is available here.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><span id=\"attachment_891448\" class=\"attachment-inline\">\n<a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/399115/eu-reach-clp-regs-report.pdf\">Scoping study for the evaluation of EU <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> and CLP regulations final report</a>\n(<span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">2.63MB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">190 pages</span>)\n</span></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><span id=\"attachment_891449\" class=\"attachment-inline\">\n<a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/399117/eu-reach-clp-regs-report-annexes.pdf\">Annex 1 to 4: <abbr title=\"Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\">REACH</abbr> and CLP evaluation scoping study</a>\n(<span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">1.25MB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">108 pages</span>)\n</span></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>",
