Both events captured audiences with live performances, including by Gharvi Group, who went viral this year for their iconic ‘Blockbuster’ song.</p>\n\n<p>British High Commissioner to Pakistan, Jane Marriott CMG OBE, said:</p>\n\n<p>“Brilliantly British captures everything we love about the UK, a powerhouse of creativity, diversity, and cultural vibrancy. British films, TV dramas, songs and fashion are some of the most renowned things that connect the UK and Pakistan.”</p>\n\n<p>In Islamabad, rock band Khudgharz left crowds calling for more with their British and Pakistani covers set. In Karachi, the Acton House garden was home to “Actonbury”, a festival featuring 5 artists: Maria Unera, Jermeas Naeem, Alycia Dias, Hussain Dossa and the Honourable Artillery Company Regimental Band.</p>\n\n<p>2024 marks a significant year for artistic and people-to-people exchanges between the UK and Pakistan. Key moments include the 90th anniversary of the creation of the British Council, a thrilling test cricket series, and the release of a previously undiscovered album by late Qawwali maestro Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, ‘Chain of Light’.</p>\n\n<p>Through music and art, the events celebrated the UK’s creative sector, which generates over £50 billion in exports, shaping the global art and cultural landscape.</p>\n</div>",
