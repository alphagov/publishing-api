# Publishing API's API

This is the primary interface from publishing apps to the publishing pipeline.
Applications PUT items as JSON conforming to a schema specified in the `content_schemas` directory.

Content locations are arbitrated internally by the Publishing API, the content
is then forwarded to the live and draft content stores, and placed on the
message queue for other apps (e.g. `email-alert-service`) to consume.

### Optimistic locking (`previous_version`)

All PUT and POST endpoints take an optional JSON attribute `previous_version`
in the request. If given, the corresponding value should be a integer. This
allows the Publishing API to check that the publishing app sending the request
intends to update the latest lock version of the model in question.

If `previous_version` is provided, the Publishing API will confirm that the
provided value matches that of the edition in the Publishing API. If it
does not, a 409 Conflict response will be provided.

### Warnings

Some endpoints may return warnings along with the content. For
those that do, in the top level object for the content, there
will be a value named "warnings". This will be an object, where the
names are the warnings that are applicable, and the corresponding
values are a human readable description of the warning.

#### Content Item Blocking Publish

This warning is only applicable for documents with an edition in a draft state,
and indicates that the draft cannot be published due to the presence of an
edition of a different at the base_path this edition is using.

Some document types are exempt from this restriction, and if either the draft,
or the blocking edition are of a "substitutable" document type, upon the
publish of the draft, the blocking item will be unpublished.

## `PUT /v2/content/:content_id`

[Request/Response detail][put-content-pact]

Used to create or update a draft edition of a document. It will restrict
creation if there is different document with a draft edition using the same
`base_path`. Uses [optimistic-locking][optimistic-locking].

The request must conform to the schema. If it does not, a 422 response will be returned.

If the request is successful, this endpoint will respond with the
presented edition and [warnings](#warnings).

To ensure fast performance the result for this is pulled from a database which
is updated whenever the content store is updated. This may mean that if you
update links and then request this endpoint you may get a stale response.

You can request a fresh response by adding a query string of `generate=true`,
this response can be slow though for large link sets.

The response includes a field of `generated` and the timestamp of when the
expanded link set was generated.

If the links are generated at runtime (which happens if use `generate=true`)
a version field will be returned which will be the `stale_lock_version` for
the LinkSet of that content_id. This is a deprecated field and should not be
used as it is not a reliable indicate of the version of the links.
