    Getting all of the documents in a collection would sometimes be prohibitively expensive.
    Current link expansion behaviour special cases this so that only the grandparent document
    is expanded. Nobody's quite sure why this behaviour is desirable though, so I'm not going
    to reimplement it until we know why it's needed.

      documents: links_of_type(type: documents) {
