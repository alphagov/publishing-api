module Queries
  # This class resolves the dependencies for a given content_id and locale
  #
  # There are 3 types of dependency this resolves:
  # 1 - Documents that are linked to the subject of dependency resolution
  #     (eg for a subject of a if b has a link to a b will be returned),
  #     for certain link types these are recursed forming a tree structure.
  # 2 - Documents which have an automatic reverse link to the subject.
  #     These are items this subject links to and is represented reciprocally
  #     in the item linked to. eg if our subject (A) has a parent of B, B would
  #     automatically have a link to A of type children.
  # 3 - Translations, for the subject all locales except the one provided is
  #     added as dependencies, as well as all translations of the content_ids
  #     found.
